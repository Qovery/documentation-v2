## Overview

The `context` command manages your current working context (organization, project, environment). This allows you to run commands without specifying these parameters every time.

## Commands

### Set Context

Set your working context interactively:

```bash
qovery context set
```

Set specific organization:

```bash
qovery context set --organization "My Organization"
```

Set specific project:

```bash
qovery context set --project "My Project"
```

Set specific environment:

```bash
qovery context set --environment "production"
```

### List Contexts

List all available contexts:

```bash
qovery context list
```

### Current Context

Display current context:

```bash
qovery context current
```

## Examples

### Set Complete Context

```bash
# Interactive selection
qovery context set

# Select organization -> project -> environment
# Context saved for subsequent commands
```

### Set Organization Only

```bash
qovery context set --organization "Acme Corp"

# Now you can run commands within this org
qovery project list
```

### Check Current Context

```bash
qovery context current
# Output:
# Organization: Acme Corp
# Project: Backend Services
# Environment: production
```

### Reset Context

```bash
qovery context set
# Select different org/project/environment
```
