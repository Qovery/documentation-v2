## Overview

Try Qovery on your local machine with a demo environment. This command sets up a local Kubernetes cluster and deploys a sample application to help you learn Qovery.

## Command

```bash
qovery demo
```

## What It Does

The demo command:

1. **Sets up local Kubernetes** - Creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop or similar
2. **Installs Qovery** - Deploys Qovery components to the local cluster
3. **Deploys Sample App** - Deploys a demo application to showcase Qovery features
4. **Provides Access** - Gives you access to explore Qovery features locally

## Prerequisites

Before running the demo:

- **Docker** - Docker Desktop must be installed and running
- **Kubectl** - Kubernetes CLI should be available
- **Sufficient Resources** - At least 4GB RAM available for Docker

## Usage

```bash
qovery demo [flags]
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--help` | Show help for demo command |

## Examples

### Run Demo

```bash
# Start Qovery demo
qovery demo

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Setup local Kubernetes cluster
# - Install Qovery
# - Deploy sample application
# - Access the demo environment
```

## What You Can Try

Once the demo is running, you can:

- **Deploy Applications** - Try deploying your own apps
- **Manage Environments** - Create development/staging environments
- **View Logs** - Stream real-time logs
- **Access Shell** - Connect to running containers
- **Test Databases** - Deploy and connect to databases
- **Explore Features** - Try all Qovery CLI commands

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the demo environment:

```bash
# Stop demo (command may vary based on implementation)
# Refer to demo output for cleanup instructions
```

## Tips

<Tip>
The demo runs entirely on your local machine. It's safe to experiment without affecting any cloud resources.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the demo to learn Qovery CLI commands before working with production environments.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Ensure Docker Desktop has sufficient resources allocated (at least 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs).
</Warning>
