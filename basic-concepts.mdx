description: "Essential Qovery terminology - Organizations, Projects, Environments, and Services"
---

## Quick Overview

Qovery organizes your infrastructure in a simple hierarchy:

```
Organization (your company)
└── Project (group of related apps)
    └── Environment (dev/staging/production)
        └── Services (apps, databases, jobs)
```

Let's break down each level.

---

## Organization

Your **Organization** is your company's workspace—the top-level container for everything in Qovery.

**Key features:**
- Team collaboration across multiple projects
- Role-based access control ([RBAC](/configuration/organization/members-rbac))
- Shared cloud credentials and integrations
- Billing and cost management

<Tip>
Most companies have one Organization. Users can belong to multiple Organizations with different roles.
</Tip>

## Project

A **Project** groups related services that work together for a common purpose.

**Examples:**
- Main Application (frontend + backend + database)
- Internal Tools
- Marketing Website

**Structure:**
```
Project: "E-commerce Platform"
├── Production Environment
├── Staging Environment
└── Development Environment
```

[Learn more about Projects →](/configuration/project)

---

## Environment

An **Environment** is a deployment stage containing services at a specific version (usually tied to a Git branch).

**Common types:**
- **Production** - Live applications (`main` branch)
- **Staging** - Pre-production testing (`staging` branch)
- **Development** - Feature development (`develop` branch)
- **Preview** - Temporary per-pull-request environments

<Info>
**Preview Environments** are automatically created for each pull request and deleted when merged. Perfect for testing changes in isolation before production. [Setup guide →](/guides/advanced/preview-environments)
</Info>

[Learn more about Environments →](/configuration/environment)

## Services

**Services** are the building blocks of your environment—applications, databases, jobs, and more.

## Key Features

### Deployment Pipeline

Services deploy in stages to respect dependencies:

1. **Databases** → 2. **Jobs** → 3. **Containers** → 4. **Applications**

You can customize stages for complex workflows. [Learn more →](/configuration/deployment/pipeline)

### Environment Variables

Configure apps with variables at three levels:

- **Project level** - Shared across all environments
- **Environment level** - Shared across services in one environment
- **Service level** - Specific to one service

Qovery auto-generates connection variables:
```bash
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_HOST
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_PORT
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_DB_CONNECTION_URI
```

[Learn more →](/configuration/environment-variables)

### Networking

- **Internal**: Services communicate privately within an environment
- **Public**: Expose apps with auto-generated domains (`*.qovery.io`) or [custom domains](/guides/applications/configure-custom-domain)
- **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL/TLS certificates
