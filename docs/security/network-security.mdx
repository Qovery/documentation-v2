## Network Isolation

### VPC Isolation

Each cluster runs in isolated VPC:

- Private subnets for workloads
- Public subnets for load balancers
- No direct internet access to pods

### Namespace Isolation

Kubernetes namespace per environment:

- Network policies enforced
- Resource quotas applied
- Inter-namespace traffic blocked

## Network Policies

Control traffic between services:

```yaml
network_policies:
  - name: allow-frontend-to-backend
    from:
      - service: frontend
    to:
      - service: backend
        port: 8080
```

## TLS/SSL

### Automatic HTTPS

- Free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Automatic renewal
- TLS 1.3 support

### Custom Certificates

Upload custom certificates:

```bash
qovery certificate create \
  --name "example.com" \
  --certificate cert.pem \
  --private-key key.pem
```

## Firewall Rules

### Ingress Rules

Control incoming traffic:

- Allow HTTP/HTTPS only
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection

### Egress Rules

Control outbound traffic:

- Allowlist external APIs
- Block unnecessary outbound traffic
- Monitor data exfiltration

## Private Networking

Services communicate privately:

```
# Internal DNS
http://backend-service:8080
redis://cache:6379
postgresql://database:5432
```

## IP Allowlisting

Restrict access by IP:

```hcl
allowed_ips = [
  "203.0.113.0/24",  # Office network
  "198.51.100.0/24"  # VPN network
]
```
