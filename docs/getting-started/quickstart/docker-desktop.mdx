            The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).

            ```bash
            # Add Qovery bucket
            scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

            # Install the CLI
            scoop install qovery-cli
            ```
          </Tab>

          <Tab title="Manual">
            Install the Qovery CLI on Windows manually by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-cli/releases), and uncompress its content to `C:\Windows`.
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Docker">
        Install Docker on your local machine and run the following command:

        ```bash
        # Pull and Run the latest Qovery CLI
        docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:latest help
        ```

        Change `latest` by the version you want to use. For example, to use the version 0.58.4, run:

        ```bash
        docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:0.58.4 help
        ```

        <Info>
        `ghcr.io` is the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-cli/pkgs/container/qovery-cli).

    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Authenticate">
    Sign in to your Qovery account (or create one if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    qovery auth
    ```

    This will open your browser to complete the authentication process.

    <Tip>
    **Running in a terminal without browser access?** Use `qovery auth --headless` instead.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Set Context">
    Configure your CLI context:

    ```bash
    qovery context set
    ```

    Select your organization when prompted.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Deploy Demo Cluster">
    Install a local k3s Kubernetes cluster with Qovery on top:

    ```bash
    qovery demo up
    ```

    This command will:
    - Install k3s (lightweight Kubernetes)
    - Install Qovery agent and all required components
    - Configure networking and ingress
    - Take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete

    <Warning>
    **macOS and Windows Users**: You may be prompted for your admin password. This is necessary to properly route traffic from your host to your k3s applications.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5: Access the Console">
    Once the installation is complete, navigate to [console.qovery.com](https://console.qovery.com)

    You should see your demo cluster connected and ready to use. You can now start deploying applications!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Local Cluster

Once your demo cluster is running, you can:

- **Deploy applications** via the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
- **Use kubectl** to interact with your local k3s cluster directly
- **Use k9s** for a terminal-based Kubernetes dashboard
- **Follow our tutorials** to deploy your first application

<Tip>
The demo cluster runs entirely on your local machine, making it perfect for testing and development without cloud costs.
</Tip>

## Cleanup

When you're finished testing, remove the demo cluster:

```bash
qovery demo destroy
```

This command removes the local k3s cluster and all Qovery components from your machine.
