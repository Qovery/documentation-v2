## Your Data Stays on Your Infrastructure

**Qovery is designed so your data always stays within your own infrastructure.** This core design principle ensures maximum security and control.

<Info>
Qovery operates as a control plane that only transfers metadata using gRPC or TLS. All your application data, databases, and workloads remain exclusively within your cloud infrastructure.
</Info>

## Security Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your Infrastructure Not Exposed" icon="shield">
    Your infrastructure is never exposed. Qovery control plane only receives metadata via encrypted gRPC or TLS.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data On Your Infrastructure" icon="server">
    All data stays within your cloud account. Qovery never stores or processes your application data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Processes On Your Infrastructure" icon="microchip">
    All application processes run on your Kubernetes clusters. Qovery only manages orchestration.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Pen-Tested Regularly" icon="bug">
    Security is tested regularly by independent security agencies.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Managed Clusters">
    For Managed Clusters, Qovery manages the engine infrastructure:

    ```mermaid
    graph TB
        Control[Qovery Control Plane<br/>metadata only via gRPC/TLS]
        Engine[Qovery Engine<br/>Managed by Qovery]

        subgraph Your Infrastructure
            K8s[Kubernetes]
            AWS[AWS / GCP / Azure / Scaleway]

            K8s -->|Runs On| AWS
        end

        Control -.->|Metadata Only<br/>gRPC/TLS| Engine
        Engine -->|Manages| K8s

        style Control fill:#642DFF,color:#fff
        style Engine fill:#7D55FF,color:#fff
        style K8s fill:#326CE5,color:#fff
        style AWS fill:#FF9900,color:#000
    ```

    **Key Principles**:
    - **Control Plane Separation** - Qovery's control plane is separate from your data plane
    - **Metadata Only** - Only configuration and status metadata transits to Qovery
    - **Encrypted Communication** - All communication uses gRPC over TLS
    - **Your Cloud Account** - All resources provisioned in your cloud account
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="BYOK Clusters">
    For BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes), the engine runs in your infrastructure:

    ```mermaid
    graph TB
        Control[Qovery Control Plane<br/>metadata only via gRPC/TLS]

        subgraph Your Infrastructure
            Engine[Qovery Engine]

        style K8s fill:#326CE5,color:#fff
        style AWS fill:#FF9900,color:#000
    ```

    **Key Principles**:
    - **Full Control** - Engine runs entirely within your infrastructure
    - **Metadata Only** - Only configuration and status metadata transits to Qovery
    - **Encrypted Communication** - All communication uses gRPC over TLS
    - **Your Cloud Account** - All resources provisioned in your cloud account

## Backup and Restore

Backups and restore are frequently a nightmare to setup, especially for databases. Qovery helps you get this part **always automatically managed by the Cloud provider**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Application Rollback" icon="container-storage">
    Container applications maintain rollback capabilities through **container image retention**:

    - All successfully built container images are retained
    - Images are stored in your container registry
    - Previous versions remain available for rollback
    - No data loss when rolling back to earlier versions

    **How it works:**
    1. Every successful build creates a new container image
    2. Image is tagged with a unique identifier (commit SHA, build ID)
    3. Image is pushed to your container registry
    4. Previous images remain available for rollback

    <Tip>
    Container images act as snapshots of your application at specific points in time. You can roll back to any previous build instantly.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Backups" icon="database">
    Managed databases have automatic daily backups managed by your cloud provider:

    - **Automated daily backups** - No manual configuration required
    - **Point-in-time recovery** - Restore to specific timestamps, when available
    - **Encrypted backups** - All backups encrypted at rest

    ### Backup Retention

    Default retention periods vary by cloud provider:

    | Provider | Automated Backups | Manual Snapshots | Point-in-Time |
    |----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
    | **AWS RDS** | 7-35 days | Indefinite | Last 5 minutes |
    | **GCP Cloud SQL** | 7-365 days | Indefinite | Last second |
    | **Azure Database** | 7-35 days | Indefinite | Last 5 minutes |
    | **Scaleway** | 7 days | Indefinite | Not available |

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="PostgreSQL" icon="database" href="/configuration/database">
        Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
      </Card>

      <Card title="MySQL" icon="database" href="/configuration/database">
        Daily snapshots with configurable retention
      </Card>

      <Card title="MongoDB" icon="database" href="/configuration/database">

      <Card title="Redis" icon="database" href="/configuration/database">
        Daily snapshots of persistent data
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Tip>
    This applies to cloud-provider-managed databases. Container-based databases are not recommended for production usage, and provide no automatic backup feature.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Application Restore" icon="rotate-left">
    The Qovery configuration file resides in your Git repository with full version control.

    **Restoration Methods:**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Via Qovery Console">
        1. Go to your environment in the Qovery Console
        2. Find your application in the list of **Services**
        3. Select the version you want to restore using the **Deploy another version** button
        4. Click **Deploy**

        <Info>
        This redeploys the exact container image from the previous build - no rebuild required!
        </Info>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Via Git Rollback">
        1. Identify the commit you want to roll back to:
           ```bash
           git log --oneline
           ```

        2. Revert to that commit:
           ```bash
           # Option 1: Revert specific commit (creates new commit)
           git revert <commit-hash>

           # Option 2: Reset to specific commit (rewrites history)
           git reset --hard <commit-hash>
           git push --force
           ```

        3. Qovery automatically detects the change and redeploys

        <Warning>
        When you rollback a commit containing a Qovery configuration change, ensure there are no other changes to avoid unwanted behavior.
        </Warning>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Via CLI">
        Use the Qovery CLI to redeploy a specific version:

        ```bash
        # Redeploy specific version
        qovery application deploy -n <app-name> -c <commit-id>
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    **Best Practices:**
    - Test rollbacks in staging before production
    - Review configuration changes before rolling back
    - Communicate with your team before rollback
    - Monitor after rollback to ensure stability
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Restore" icon="database">
    Database restoration is managed by your cloud provider and creates a new database instance.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access Cloud Provider Console">
        Log into your cloud provider console (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Navigate to Database Service">
        Find your managed database service:
        - **AWS**: RDS or DocumentDB
        - **GCP**: Cloud SQL or Firestore
        - **Azure**: Azure Database
        - **Scaleway**: Managed Databases
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select Restore Point">
        Choose your restoration method:

        **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):**
        - Restore to any time within retention period
        - Most accurate recovery method
        - No data loss up to the specific second

        **Snapshot Restore:**
        - Restore from daily automated snapshots
        - Faster than PITR
        - Some data loss possible (data since last snapshot)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create New Database Instance">
        Cloud providers create a new database instance from the backup:
        1. Configure instance settings
        2. Choose VPC and security groups
        3. Wait for restoration to complete (5-30 minutes)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Update Application Configuration">
        Update your application to point to the new database:
        1. In Qovery Console, go to your application
        2. Update environment variables with new database endpoint
        3. Redeploy your application
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify and Cleanup">
        1. Verify data integrity in restored database
        2. Test application connectivity
        3. Delete old database instance if no longer needed
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    Database restores create a **new instance**. Your application will need to be reconfigured to use the restored database endpoint.
    </Warning>
