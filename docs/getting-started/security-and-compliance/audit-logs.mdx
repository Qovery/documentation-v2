<Info>
Audit Logs is currently in **public beta**. Access and functionalities may change based on your Qovery Plan.
</Info>

Qovery allows you to monitor any action happened within your organization thanks to the audit logs section.

This feature enables you to track all changes to your organizational configuration, answering **who did what, where, and when?**

## Access

Navigate to the `Audit logs` section from the left navigation bar in the Qovery Console.

## Event Retention

Events are retained for a maximum of **30 days**.

## How It Works

Qovery tracks in the audit logs any call happening on our API for your organization.

For example, when you modify an application via the console, an `UPDATE` event is logged from the API endpoint call that was made.

## Event Information

Each logged event includes the following information:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Event Type**: Category of action (Create, Update, Delete, Trigger Deployment, etc.)
- **Target Type**: Type of object that was modified (Environment, Cluster, Role, Container Registry, etc.)
- **Target**: The specific object that was modified (hover to see details)
- **Change**: High-level description of the modification
- **User**: Who made the changes (or API token name if automated)
- **Tool**: Method used to make the change (Console, Terraform provider, Git push, etc.)

### View Event Details

You can click on any event to reveal the JSON response containing the post-event object status. This is useful for granular change comparison.

## Filters

You can filter audit logs by:

- **Time range** - Select a specific date range
- **Target specification** - First select the target type, then select the specific name

### Quick Filters

Throughout the Qovery Console, you'll find quick access to audit logs via the **"See Events"** button in the 3-dot submenus. This allows you to quickly filter and view events for specific resources.

## Export

You can export audit logs using the Qovery CLI:

```bash
qovery audit-log export \
  --from-date="2025-10-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --to-date="2025-09-10T00:00:00Z"
```

**Requirements:**

- Dates must be in **ISO-8601 format** (UTC-based)
- Offset format is also supported (e.g., `2025-10-01T01:00:00+02:00`)
- `--from-date` is **required**
- `--to-date` is **optional** (defaults to current datetime if not specified)
