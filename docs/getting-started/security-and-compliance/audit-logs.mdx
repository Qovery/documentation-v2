Qovery allows you to monitor any action happened within your organization thanks to the audit logs section.

This feature enables you to track all changes to your organizational configuration, answering **who did what, where, and when?**

## Access

Navigate to the `Audit logs` section from the left navigation bar in the Qovery Console.

## Event Retention

The event retention depends on your plan:
- **User**: 3 days
- **Team**: 7 days
- **Business**: 30 days
- **Enterprise**: Custom

## How It Works

Qovery tracks in the audit logs any call happening on our API for your organization.

For example, when you modify an application via the console, an `UPDATE` event is logged from the API endpoint call that was made.

## Event Information

Each logged event includes the following information:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Event Type**: Category of action (Create, Update, Delete, Trigger Deployment, etc.)
- **Target Type**: Type of object that was modified (Environment, Cluster, Role, Container Registry, etc.)
- **Target**: The specific object that was modified (hover to see details)
- **Change**: High-level description of the modification
- **User**: Who made the changes (or API token name if automated)
- **Tool**: Method used to make the change (Console, Terraform provider, Git push, etc.)

### View Event Details

You can click on any event to reveal the JSON response containing the post-event object status. This is useful for granular change comparison.
