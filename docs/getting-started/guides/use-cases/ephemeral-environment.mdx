title: "Ephemeral Environments"
description: "Create on-demand temporary environments for development, testing, and E2E testing with automated CI/CD workflows"
---

## Overview

Ephemeral environments are temporary, isolated environments that are automatically created for specific purposes (like feature development or testing) and destroyed when no longer needed. They provide developers with production-like environments without the cost and complexity of maintaining permanent infrastructure.

Ephemeral environments (also called Preview Environments) are automatically created when you open a pull request and deleted when it's merged or closed, giving you on-demand testing environments that mirror your production setup.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Cluster Required**: Before setting up ephemeral environments, you need a Kubernetes cluster. Ephemeral environments will be created on this cluster.
</Warning>

**Don't have a cluster yet?**

  <Card title="Managed Cluster (Recommended)" icon="cloud" href="/getting-started/quickstart/cloud">
    Let Qovery provision and manage your Kubernetes cluster on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway

    **Time:** ~30 minutes | **Maintenance:** Qovery handles it
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bring Your Own Cluster (BYOK)" icon="server" href="/configuration/integrations/kubernetes/byok">
    Connect your existing Kubernetes cluster or create your own

## Two Approaches

Qovery offers **two approaches** to create and manage ephemeral environments, depending on your team's needs and technical requirements.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Simple: Preview Environments" icon="bolt" href="/getting-started/guides/use-cases/preview-environments">
    **Fully Automated with Zero Configuration**

    Turn on auto-preview environment feature in Qovery and let it handle everything automatically.

    - No CI/CD setup required
    - Built-in Qovery feature
    - Instant setup (enable and go)
    - Automatic creation/destruction on PR events
    - Perfect for quick feedback
    - **Best for teams wanting simplicity**

    **Time to setup:** 10-15 minutes
  </Card>

  <Card title="Advanced: CI/CD Integration" icon="code" href="/getting-started/guides/use-cases/e2e-testing">
    **Custom Workflows with E2E Testing**

    Integrate ephemeral environments into your existing CI/CD pipeline for complete control.

    - Full workflow customization
    - E2E testing automation (K6, Playwright, Cypress)
    - Custom creation/deletion logic
    - Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
    - Advanced testing scenarios
    - **Best for teams requiring custom testing workflows**

    **Time to setup:** 1-2 hours
