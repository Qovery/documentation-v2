## Overview

Qovery Provision automates the setup and configuration of your cloud infrastructure on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway. It handles the complexities of cluster provisioning, networking, and infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on deploying applications rather than managing infrastructure.

## Cluster Provisioning Architecture

When you create a cluster, Qovery provisions:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Qovery Console] -->|Initiates| B[Cloud Provider API]
    B --> C[VPC/Network]
    B --> D[Kubernetes Cluster]
    B --> E[Load Balancer]
    B --> F[Object Storage]

    C --> D
    E --> D
    D --> G[Node Group 1]
    D --> H[Node Group 2]
    D --> I[Node Group N]

    D --> J[Qovery Agent]
    J --> K[Monitoring]
    J --> L[Logging]
    J --> M[Auto-scaling]
```

**Components Provisioned**:

1. **VPC/Virtual Network**: Isolated network infrastructure
2. **Kubernetes Control Plane**: Managed Kubernetes API server
3. **Node Groups**: Worker nodes with auto-scaling
4. **Load Balancer**: External traffic routing
5. **Object Storage**: Container images and logs
6. **IAM Roles**: Service accounts and permissions
7. **Qovery Agent**: Cluster management and monitoring

## Cluster Types

### Managed Clusters

Qovery provisions and manages the entire cluster lifecycle.

**Pros**:

- Fully automated setup and maintenance
- Automatic updates and security patches
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Cost optimization features

**Best For**: Production workloads, teams without dedicated DevOps

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes)

Connect your existing Kubernetes cluster to Qovery - perfect for organizations with existing infrastructure or specific compliance requirements.

**What Qovery Manages**:

- ✅ Application deployments and orchestration
- ✅ Developer experience and workflows
- ✅ Application monitoring and logs

**What You Manage**:

- ❌ Kubernetes cluster lifecycle
- ❌ Infrastructure components (ingress, DNS, storage)
- ❌ Cluster upgrades and maintenance

**Best For**: Organizations with Kubernetes expertise and existing clusters (on-premise, edge, any cloud provider)
