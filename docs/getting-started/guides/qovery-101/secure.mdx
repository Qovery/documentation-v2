## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Qovery implements a role-based access control system to manage member permissions across your organization, clusters, projects, and environments.

### Default Roles

Qovery provides 5 default roles with predefined permissions:

| Action | Owner | Admin | DevOps | Billing Manager | Viewer |

| Read organization | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Edit organization | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Delete organization | yes | no | no | no | no |
| Manage billing | yes | yes | no | yes | no |
| Manage members & roles | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Manage cluster & container registry | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| Manage organization setup | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| Read ANY project | yes | yes | yes | no | yes |
| Edit/Delete ANY project | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Create project | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Read ANY environment | yes | yes | yes | no | yes |
| Edit/Delete ANY environment or service | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Create environment or service | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Add/Edit/Delete environment variables and secrets | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| Deploy/Stop ANY environment or service | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| Connect via shell to ANY application | yes | yes | yes | no | no |
| View audit logs | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Manage API tokens | yes | yes | no | no | no |

<Note>
Only one Owner per organization is allowed.
</Note>

### Custom Roles

Create tailored roles when default options are insufficient.

**Cluster-Level Access**:
- **Read-Only**: View cluster information
- **Create Environment**: Deploy new environments on specific clusters
- **Full Access**: Manage cluster settings and create environments

**Project-Level Access** (by environment type):
- **No Access**: Cannot see the project
- **Read-Only**: View without modification
- **Deploy**: Handle deployments and logs, manage variables
- **Manage**: Modify deployments and environment structure
- **Full Access**: Complete project administration

<Note>
Users with custom roles cannot create clusters or manage organization-wide settings like webhooks or API tokens.
</Note>

<Warning>
Members need to logout/login to activate role changes, or changes take effect within one hour maximum.
</Warning>

**Configure RBAC**:
1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Members**
2. Click **Invite Member** or edit existing member
3. Select role (default or custom)
4. Configure project/environment access if using custom role
5. Send invitation

## Secrets Management

Qovery provides secure environment variable and secrets management for your applications.

### Variable Types

**Classic Variables**: Standard key-value pairs accessible at build time and runtime.

**Secrets**: Encrypted variables with values inaccessible through API or UI. Values are only available to applications during execution.

**File-Based Variables**: Variables stored as files at a specified path. Your application accesses the file location via the variable name.

### Variable Scopes

Variables operate at three hierarchical levels:

1. **Project**: Shared across all environments and applications within the project
2. **Environment**: Shared across all applications within one environment
3. **Application**: Available to a single application only

### Built-in Variables

Qovery automatically generates variables following the pattern `QOVERY_<SERVICE_TYPE>_<SERVICE_ID>_<SPEC>`, enabling easy service interconnection.

Examples:
```bash
# Database connection
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRES_HOST
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRES_PORT
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRES_USERNAME
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_POSTGRES_DATABASE

# Application URL
QOVERY_APPLICATION_MY_API_URL
```

### Creating Secrets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console">
    1. Navigate to your **Application** → **Variables**
    2. Click **Add Variable**
    3. Enter variable key
    4. Select **Secret** type
    5. Enter secret value
    6. Choose scope (Application, Environment, or Project)
    7. Click **Save**

    <Note>
    Secret values are encrypted and cannot be viewed after creation. Only the first and last 3 characters are shown.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Terraform">
    ```hcl
    resource "qovery_application" "my_app" {
      name           = "my-app"
      environment_id = qovery_environment.production.id

      secrets = [
        {
          key   = "DATABASE_PASSWORD"
          value = var.database_password
        },
        {
          key   = "API_KEY"
          value = var.api_key
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Audit Logs

Qovery's audit logs enable organizations to track all actions and changes within their system.

### What Gets Tracked

Qovery monitors all API calls for your organization, including:

- Application deployments
- Configuration changes
- Environment modifications
- Cluster updates
- User management actions
- RBAC changes
- Secret modifications
- API token usage

### Event Details

Each logged event includes:

- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred
- **Event Type**: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, TRIGGER_DEPLOYMENT, etc.
- **Target Type**: Environment, Cluster, Role, Application, Database, etc.
- **Target**: The specific object modified
- **Change**: High-level description of what was modified
- **User**: Who made the change (or API token name if via API)
- **Tool**: How the change was made (Console, Terraform, CLI, Git push)

### Accessing Audit Logs

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings**
2. Click **Audit Logs** in the left sidebar
3. View the list of all events
4. Use filters to narrow down results:
   - Time range
   - Target type
   - Target name
   - Event type
5. Click on an event to see full details including JSON response

### Use Cases

- **Security Monitoring**: Track unauthorized access attempts
- **Compliance**: Maintain records for audits (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify what changed before an incident
- **Team Accountability**: Track who made specific changes
- **Change Management**: Review all infrastructure modifications

### Retention

Audit logs retention period depends on your [Qovery plan](https://www.qovery.com/pricing). Export logs regularly if you need longer retention for compliance purposes.
