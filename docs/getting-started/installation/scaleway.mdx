</Info>

### Networking Configuration

Qovery automatically configures Scaleway networking:

**What's Created:**
- Private Network (VPC) with custom CIDR
- Load Balancer for ingress traffic
- Public Gateway for NAT (outbound internet)
- Security Groups for firewall rules
- Automatic DNS configuration

<Accordion title="Advanced Networking Options">
  **Qovery-Managed VPC (Default):**
  Qovery creates a dedicated Private Network for your cluster with optimal configuration.

  **Existing VPC:**
  Deploy into your own Private Network to connect with existing Scaleway resources.

  **Load Balancer:**
  Scaleway Load Balancer automatically configured for HTTP/HTTPS ingress with SSL termination.

  **VPC Peering:**
  Configure Private Network routes after deployment to connect to databases or other services.
</Accordion>

#### Static IP for Egress Traffic

By default, Scaleway clusters use random public IPs for outbound traffic. If you need a stable egress IP for IP allowlisting with external services, Qovery provides a Static IP feature.

**Benefits:**
- **Predictable outbound IP**: Your cluster uses a fixed IP address for all egress traffic
- **IP allowlist compatibility**: External services can whitelist your static IP
- **Stable connections**: Maintain consistent identity for outbound API calls and integrations

**How to Enable:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="During Cluster Creation">
    In the networking configuration step, enable the **Static IP for egress traffic** option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="For Existing Clusters">
    1. Navigate to your cluster settings in the Qovery Console
    2. Go to the **Network** section
    3. Enable **Static IP for egress traffic**
    4. Update your cluster to apply the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

**NAT Gateway Types:**

When you enable Static IP for egress traffic, Qovery deploys a Scaleway Public Gateway with NAT functionality. Choose the gateway size based on your expected outbound traffic:

| Gateway Type | Bandwidth | Use Case |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **VPC-GW-S** | Up to 100 Mbps | Small development environments, low traffic |
| **VPC-GW-M** | Up to 1 Gbps | Standard production workloads |
| **VPC-GW-L** | Up to 3 Gbps | High-traffic applications |
| **VPC-GW-XL** | Up to 10 Gbps | Very high-traffic, enterprise workloads |

<Info>
For detailed specifications and pricing, see [Scaleway Public Gateway documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/vpc/concepts/#public-gateways) and [pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/pricing/network/).
</Info>

<Info>
The Static IP feature is particularly useful when connecting to:
- External databases with IP-based authentication
- Third-party APIs requiring IP allowlisting
- Enterprise services with strict security policies
- Partner integrations that need stable source IPs
</Info>

### Control Plane Options

<Accordion title="Control Plane Tiers">
  **Mutualized (Free) - Recommended for most users:**
  - Shared Kubernetes control plane
  - No additional cost
  - Suitable for development, staging, and production
  - 99.9% SLA

  **Dedicated (Paid) - For high-performance needs:**
