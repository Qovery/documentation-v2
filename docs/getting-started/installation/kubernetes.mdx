Qovery Self-Managed (also known as BYOK: Bring Your Own Kubernetes) is a self-hosted version of Qovery. It allows you to install Qovery on your own Kubernetes cluster.

<Warning>
**For Kubernetes Experts Only**: Qovery BYOK is for Kubernetes experts who want to manage their own Kubernetes cluster. If you are not familiar with Kubernetes, we recommend using [Qovery-Managed Kubernetes](/installation/aws) on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway.
</Warning>

<Note>
Qovery automatically updates ONLY the Qovery applications (agent, shell-agent, etc.) via the Qovery Helm chart. With the self-managed offer, it will be up to you to manage any dependency components (ingress, DNS, logging), making sure they run with the right version over time.

The dependencies provided with the Qovery Helm chart are here to help you with the bootstrap, and are not maintained by Qovery. If you want to simplify the maintenance of your cluster, please look at the [Qovery managed Kubernetes offer](/installation/aws).
</Note>

    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="MacOS">
    <Tabs>

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Scoop">
        The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).

        ```bash
        # Add Qovery bucket
        scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Docker">
    Install Docker on your local machine and run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Pull and Run the latest Qovery CLI
    docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:latest help
    ```

    Change `latest` by the version you want to use. For example, to use the version 0.58.4, run:

    ```bash
    docker run ghcr.io/qovery/qovery-cli:0.58.4 help

</Info>

### Step 2: Authenticate

Authenticate with your Qovery account:

```bash
qovery auth
```

This will open a browser window for authentication.

<Tip>
For headless environments (CI/CD, remote servers) without a graphical interface, use `qovery auth --headless` and follow the instructions to authenticate manually.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Deploy to Kubernetes

Run the installation command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
qovery cluster install
```

The installation typically takes 5-10 minutes.

## Post-Installation

After successful deployment:

1. **Validate Installation**: Check that all Qovery components are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n qovery
   ```

2. **Verify in Console**: Log in to [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com) to confirm your cluster appears with a **Connected** status.

3. **Deploy Applications**: You can now start deploying your applications through the Qovery Console.

<Tip>
For comprehensive validation steps and troubleshooting, see the [BYOK Integration Guide](/integrations/kubernetes/byok).
