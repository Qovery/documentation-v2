Qovery Self-Managed (also known as BYOK: Bring Your Own Kubernetes) is a self-hosted version of Qovery. It allows you to install Qovery on your own Kubernetes cluster.

<Warning>
  **For Kubernetes Experts Only**: Qovery BYOK is for Kubernetes experts who
  want to manage their own Kubernetes cluster.
</Warning>

<Note>
Qovery automatically updates ONLY the Qovery applications (agent, shell-agent, etc.) via the Qovery Helm chart. With the self-managed offer, it will be up to you to manage any dependency components (ingress, DNS, logging), making sure they run with the right version over time.

The dependencies provided with the Qovery Helm chart are here to help you with the bootstrap, and are not maintained by Qovery.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

<Check>An operational Kubernetes cluster (any distribution)</Check>
<Check>Minimum 4 CPUs and 8GB RAM available in your cluster</Check>
<Check>`kubectl` installed and configured for cluster access</Check>
<Check>`helm` package manager installed</Check>
<Check>Active Qovery account - [Sign up here](https://start.qovery.com)</Check>

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Qovery CLI

Install the Qovery CLI on your local machine:

<InstallQoveryCLI />

### Step 2: Authenticate

Authenticate with your Qovery account:

```bash
qovery auth
```

This will open a browser window for authentication.

<Tip>
  For headless environments (CI/CD, remote servers) without a graphical
  interface, use `qovery auth --headless` and follow the instructions to
  authenticate manually.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Deploy to Kubernetes

Run the installation command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
qovery cluster install
```

The installation typically takes 5-10 minutes.

## Post-Installation

After successful deployment:

1. **Validate Installation**: Check that all Qovery components are running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n qovery
   ```

2. **Verify in Console**: Log in to [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com) to confirm your cluster appears with a **Connected** status.

3. **Deploy Applications**: You can now start deploying your applications through the Qovery Console.

<Tip>
  For comprehensive validation steps and troubleshooting, see the [BYOK
  Integration Guide](/configuration/integrations/kubernetes/byok).
