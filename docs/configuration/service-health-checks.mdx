description: "Configure liveness and readiness probes to monitor your application health"

Health checks are automated procedures that monitor application status, determining readiness for traffic or restart needs. Qovery leverages Kubernetes probes for continuous verification during deployment and runtime phases.

## Kubernetes Probe Types

Qovery utilizes two primary probe mechanisms:

- **Liveness probe**: Verifies container vitality. Failed checks trigger container restarts, addressing issues like deadlocks where applications run but cannot progress.
- **Readiness probe**: Confirms container readiness for incoming requests. Traffic routes only to ready pods; unready containers are removed from load balancers.

During deployment, both probes must succeed for successful completion if configured.

## Probes Configuration Parameters

### Type

Configure probe execution method:

- **NONE**: Disables the probe (not recommended for liveness probes)
- **HTTP probes**: Ping specified path/port; success requires 200-300 range responses
- **TCP probes**: Establish port connections; successful connections indicate health
- **gRPC probes**: Connect to specified port/service; successful connections confirm health
- **EXEC probes**: Execute container commands; failed execution = probe failure

### Initial Delay (in seconds)

Specifies interval between container start and first liveness check. Useful for applications requiring extended boot time.

### Period (in seconds)

Sets interval between consecutive probe executions.

### Timeout (in seconds)

Defines maximum wait time for probe response.

### Success Threshold

Minimum consecutive successes required after previous failures (limited to 1 by Kubernetes).

### Failure Threshold

Minimum consecutive failures required to mark probe as failed after successes.

## Long-Starting Applications

Applications with extended boot operations may fail deployment if probes cannot verify status within timeframes. Look for warnings:

```
"Liveness probe failed: dial tcp xx.xx.xx.xx:xx: connect: connection refused"
```

<Tip>
Increase **Initial Delay** settings to match your application boot duration to prevent premature probe failures.

<Warning>
Startup probes are not yet available in Qovery.
