## Overview

The **Cloud Credentials Management** interface provides a centralized location to view and manage all cloud provider credentials. These credentials are automatically listed when a cluster is provisioned.

This interface gives you visibility into all credentials, allows you to see which clusters are using them, and provides actions to update or delete them as needed.

## Viewing Credentials and Their Usage

Each cloud credential is displayed with details such as:
- Credential name
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Scaleway)
- Public access key or ARN role
- Associated clusters

Next to each credential, you'll find a **View Associated Clusters** button. Clicking it opens a list of all clusters that are currently using the credential, helping you assess the impact before making changes.

## Editing a Credential

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Edit Button">
    Locate the credential you want to modify and click the **Edit** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Credential Properties">
    Modify key properties such as:
    - Access keys
    - Secret keys
    - Configuration settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Changes are saved and applied to the system immediately. Updated credentials will be used during the **next deployment** of each associated cluster.
</Info>

## Deleting a Credential

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Associated Clusters">
    Click **View Associated Clusters** to see which clusters use this credential
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Associations">
    If the credential is linked to clusters, remove the association from those clusters first
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete Credential">
    Once no clusters are associated, click the **Delete** button
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If a credential is still linked to one or more clusters, deletion won't be possible. You must first remove its association from those clusters.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Usage Before Changes">
    Always check associated clusters by clicking the **View Associated Clusters** button before editing or deleting credentials. This helps prevent disruptions during future deployments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Assign clear, descriptive names to credentials for easier identification. Examples:
    - `aws-prod-us-east-1`
    - `gcp-staging-europe`
    - `azure-dev-westus`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Credential Rotation">
    Periodically rotate cloud credentials for security:
    1. Create new credentials in your cloud provider
    2. Edit the credential in Qovery with new values
    3. Deploy clusters to apply new credentials
    4. Delete old credentials from your cloud provider
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean Up Unused Credentials">
    Regularly review and delete unused credentials to maintain a secure environment and reduce clutter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use IAM Roles When Possible">
    For AWS, prefer IAM roles over access keys for better security:
    - More secure (no long-lived credentials)
    - Easier to manage and rotate
    - Better audit trail in CloudTrail
  </Accordion>
