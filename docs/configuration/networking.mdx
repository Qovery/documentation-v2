## Internal Networking

Services communicate via internal DNS:

```
http://my-service:8080
```

## External Access

### Public URLs

Applications with `publicly_accessible: true` get:

- Automatic HTTPS
- Load balancing
- DDoS protection

### Custom Domains

Add custom domains:

```hcl
custom_domains = [
  "api.example.com",
  "www.example.com"
]
```

## Network Policies

Control traffic between services:

- Allow list specific services
- Deny traffic by default
- Namespace isolation

## Load Balancing

- Round-robin by default
- Session affinity (sticky sessions)
- Health check based routing
