Qovery has a direct integration to create and manage AWS EKS Anywhere clusters. This feature is available upon request. Please [contact our team](https://www.qovery.com/contact) to enable this integration for your organization.
</Info>

## Overview

AWS EKS Anywhere allows you to run Amazon EKS on your own infrastructure - whether on-premise, at edge locations, or in private data centers. Qovery provides a streamlined integration to deploy and manage EKS Anywhere clusters directly from the Qovery Console.

## What is EKS Anywhere?

EKS Anywhere is a deployment option for Amazon EKS that brings the same Kubernetes experience to your own infrastructure:

- **On-premise data centers** - Run Kubernetes on your own hardware
- **Edge locations** - Deploy closer to your data sources and users
- **Private clouds** - Maintain full control over your infrastructure
- **Air-gapped environments** - Deploy in isolated, secure environments
