## Overview

Run Qovery on your local machine using Docker and k3s (lightweight Kubernetes). Perfect for development, testing, and learning without cloud costs or Docker Desktop requirements.

<Warning>
**Demo Environment Only**: This local installation is designed for demonstration and testing purposes only. It is **not intended for production use**.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

**System Requirements:**
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL only)
- **CPU & Memory**: Minimum 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM for Docker
- **Software**:
  - Docker daemon running (Docker Desktop not required, especially on Linux)
  - Git
  - Common utilities: `jq`, `curl`, `sed`, `grep` (usually pre-installed)

<Note>
**Linux Users**: You only need Docker Engine running on your machine. Docker Desktop is not required.
</Note>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Qovery CLI">
    <InstallQoveryCLI />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Sign in to your Qovery account (or create one if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    qovery auth
    ```

    This will open your browser to complete the authentication process.

    <Tip>
    **Running in a terminal without browser access?** Use `qovery auth --headless` instead.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Context">
    Configure your CLI context:

    ```bash
    qovery context set
    ```

    Select your organization when prompted.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Local Cluster">
    Install a local k3s Kubernetes cluster with Qovery:

    ```bash
    qovery demo up
    ```

    This command will:
    - Install k3s (lightweight Kubernetes)
    - Install Qovery agent and all required components
    - Configure networking and ingress
    - Take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete

    <Warning>
    **macOS and Windows Users**: You may be prompted for your admin password. This is necessary to properly route traffic from your host to your k3s applications.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Console">
    Once the installation is complete, navigate to [console.qovery.com](https://console.qovery.com)

    You should see your demo cluster connected and ready to use. You can now start deploying applications!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Local Cluster

Once your local cluster is running, you can:

- **Deploy applications** via the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
- **Use kubectl** to interact with your local k3s cluster directly
- **Use k9s** for a terminal-based Kubernetes dashboard
- **Follow tutorials** to deploy applications locally

<Tip>
The local cluster runs entirely on your machine, making it perfect for testing and development without cloud costs.
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Warning>
Local Kubernetes is **NOT for production**:
- Single node (no high availability)
- Limited resources
- Loses data on restart
- Performance limitations
</Warning>

## Cleanup

When you're finished testing, remove the local cluster:

```bash
qovery demo destroy
```

This command removes the local k3s cluster and all Qovery components from your machine.
