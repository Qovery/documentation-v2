## Overview

The Email integration enables you to receive real-time alerts when your services trigger monitoring conditions (CPU, memory, errors, latency, etc.). Configure SMTP settings to send alert notifications directly to your team's email addresses.

## Add Email Notification Channel

1. Navigate to the **Alerting** section in the Qovery Console navigation menu
2. Click on **Notification channel**
3. Click the **New email** button in the Email section
4. In the **New email** modal, configure the following fields:

### Required Fields

- **Display name**: Enter a descriptive name for this notification channel (e.g., "Production Alerts", "DevOps Team Email")
  <Info>This name will be displayed on your Qovery interface</Info>

- **To email**: The recipient email address that will receive alert notifications (e.g., `user@example.com`)

- **From email**: The sender email address that will appear in the "From" field (e.g., `alerts@yourcompany.com`)
  <Info>This email address will appear as the sender of alert notifications</Info>

### SMTP Configuration

Configure your SMTP server settings to send email notifications:

- **SMTP Server**: Your SMTP server address and port (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com:587`)
  <Info>Format: `host:port`</Info>

- **SMTP Username**: The username for authenticating with your SMTP server (e.g., `username@example.com`)

- **SMTP Password**: The password for authenticating with your SMTP server

- **Require TLS**: Enable to force TLS encryption for the SMTP connection (recommended for security)

<Tip>
For common SMTP providers:
- **Gmail**: `smtp.gmail.com:587` with TLS enabled (requires app-specific password)
- **Office 365**: `smtp.office365.com:587` with TLS enabled
- **SendGrid**: `smtp.sendgrid.net:587` with TLS enabled
- **Amazon SES**: `email-smtp.region.amazonaws.com:587` with TLS enabled
</Tip>

5. Click **Send test notification** to verify your SMTP configuration is working correctly

<Info>
The test email may take a few minutes to arrive depending on your email provider. Check your inbox and spam folder.
</Info>

6. Click **Confirm creation** to save the email notification channel

## Test the Integration

Create a test alert with a low threshold to verify notifications are sent to your designated email address. See the [Alert Conditions guide](/configuration/integrations/observability/qovery-observe#alerts) for details on creating alerts.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving emails, check the following:

- Verify your SMTP credentials are correct
- Ensure your SMTP server allows connections from Qovery's IP addresses
- Check if your email provider requires app-specific passwords (e.g., Gmail with 2FA enabled)
- Verify the "From email" address is authorized to send through your SMTP server
- Check your spam/junk folder for test notifications
- Enable TLS if your SMTP provider requires encrypted connections
