Deploy your applications with CircleCI using the Qovery CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy your application with CircleCI, you need to:

1. Install the [Qovery CLI](/cli/overview)
2. Generate a [Qovery API token](/configuration/organization/api-token) (via CLI or Console)
3. Set the environment variable `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your API token
4. Disable [Qovery Auto Deployment](/configuration/deployment/auto-deploy) on the services you want to deploy manually

## CircleCI Configuration

Since CircleCI also provides a `.yaml` file to configure your pipeline, refer to [GitLab CI](/integrations/ci-cd/gitlab-ci) and [GitHub Actions](/integrations/ci-cd/github-actions) examples to learn how to configure your pipeline with Qovery.

## Deploy a Single Application

Use the Qovery CLI to deploy a single application:

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "Production" \
  --application "myapp" \
  --commit-id <commit-id> \
  --watch
```

## Deploy Multiple Applications

### Different Applications with Different Commits

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "Production" \
  --application "app1" \
  --commit-id <commit-id-1> \
  --watch

qovery application deploy \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "Production" \
  --application "app2" \
  --commit-id <commit-id-2> \
  --watch
```

### Multiple Applications with the Same Commit (Monorepo)

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "Production" \
  --applications "app1,app2,app3" \
  --commit-id <commit-id> \
  --watch
```

## Manage Preview Environments

### Clone an Environment

```bash
qovery environment clone \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "Production" \
  --new-environment-name "preview-pr-123" \
  --cluster "my-cluster"
```

### Update Application Branch in Cloned Environment

```bash
qovery application update \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "preview-pr-123" \
  --application "myapp" \
  --branch "feature-branch"
```

### Deploy the Preview Environment

```bash
qovery application deploy \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "preview-pr-123" \
  --application "myapp" \
  --commit-id <commit-id> \
  --watch
```

### Delete Preview Environment

```bash
qovery environment delete \
  --organization "My Organization" \
  --project "My Project" \
  --environment "preview-pr-123" \
  --yes
```

## Integration with Terraform

If you're using Terraform to manage your infrastructure, you can integrate it with your CI/CD pipeline. See the [Terraform Provider documentation](/using-qovery/interface/terraform-provider) for more information.
