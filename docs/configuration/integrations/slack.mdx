## Overview

The Slack integration enables automatic team notifications for two use cases:

- **Deployment notifications**: Get notified whenever changes occur within your applications (deployments, failures, etc.)
- **Alerting notifications**: Receive real-time alerts when your services trigger monitoring conditions (CPU, memory, errors, latency, etc.)

<Note>
  Choose your use case below. Steps 1 and 2 are common for both integrations.
  Step 3 differs depending on your needs.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

Navigate to the [Slack app creation page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and build a new application from scratch. The app should be named "Qovery" and connected to the desired workspace.

<Info>
  You can customize your Slack app with an optional logo available from
  [Qovery's public resources
  repository](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6046393ad41fc8c21e77d3d7/60c0dc4f7c3f2e3e6e2c3b5f_qovery-logo-square.png).

## Step 2: Configure Incoming Webhooks

Activate the Incoming Webhooks feature within your app, then add a new webhook to your workspace. Select the target notification channel and copy the generated webhook URL.

## Step 3: Configure Slack in Qovery

Choose your use case:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Deployment Notifications">
    ### Configure Qovery Webhook

    Reference the [webhook documentation](/configuration/integrations/webhooks) to establish the connection within Qovery, using the copied Slack webhook URL as the endpoint.

    <Note>
    Multiple webhooks can target different channels. Specific events can be filtered (e.g., `"events": ["DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE"]`). Webhooks are manageable and deletable anytime.
    </Note>

    ### Test the Integration

    Launch a deployment to verify notifications appear in your designated Slack channel.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Alerting Notifications">
    ### Add Notification Channel

    1. Navigate to the **Alerting** section in the Qovery Console navigation menu
    2. Click on **Notification channel**
    3. Click the **Add channel** button
    4. In the **New channel** modal:
       - **Display name**: Enter a descriptive name for this notification channel (e.g., "Production Alerts", "Team DevOps")
       - **Webhook URL**: Paste the webhook URL you copied from Step 2
    5. Click **Confirm creation**

    <Tip>
    The display name is how this channel will appear when configuring alerts. Choose a clear name that indicates which Slack channel or team will receive these notifications.
    </Tip>

    ### Test the Integration

    Create a test alert with a low threshold to verify notifications appear in your designated Slack channel. See the [Alert Conditions guide](/configuration/integrations/observability/qovery-observe#alerts) for details on creating alerts.
