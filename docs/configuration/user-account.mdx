## Account Information

### Name Fields

<Info>
To update your name, you need to modify it in your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) settings.
</Info>

### Account Email

Your **account email** is sourced from your Git credentials and cannot be modified within Qovery. This email is used for authentication and account identification.

<Info>
To change your account email, update it in your Git provider settings. The change will be reflected in Qovery after your next login.

### Communication Email

The **communication email** is a customizable field where you designate your preferred contact address for product updates, announcements, and important notifications.
