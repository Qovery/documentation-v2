## Job Types

### Cron Jobs

Scheduled tasks that run periodically:

```hcl
resource "qovery_job" "backup" {
  environment_id = qovery_environment.prod.id
  name           = "daily-backup"
  
  schedule = {
    cronjob = {
      schedule = "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM daily
    }
  }
  
  source = {
    docker = {
      git_repository = {
        url    = "https://github.com/your-org/backup-job"
        branch = "main"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle Jobs

Run during environment lifecycle events:

- **Start**: Before environment starts
- **Stop**: Before environment stops  
- **Delete**: Before environment deletion

```hcl
lifecycle_type = "START"
```

## Configuration
