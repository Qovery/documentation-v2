## Overview

An environment is a group of applications, databases, and services running within the same Kubernetes namespace. Each environment provides isolation and organization for your services across different stages of your development lifecycle.

## Types of Environment

Qovery supports four environment modes, each designed for specific use cases:

### Production

**Critical environment** for live applications serving real users.

<Warning>
Production environments should not be stopped or deleted by anyone without careful consideration and proper approval.
</Warning>

### Staging

**Production-like environment** for final testing before deployment. Often reflects production conditions and is critical for companies to validate changes before release.

### Development

**Working environment** for developing and testing features. Used by developers for day-to-day work, testing, and experimentation.

### Preview

**Ephemeral environment** automatically created for pull requests. Temporary environments that can be auto-deleted when no longer needed.

## Create an Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Project">
    Navigate to the project where you want to create the environment

    ![Create Environment](/images/configuration/environment/create_environment_1.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Environment">
    Click the **Create Environment** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    Specify the following parameters:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your environment
    - **Mode**: Select environment type (Production, Staging, Development, or Preview)
    - **Cluster**: Choose the Kubernetes cluster where the environment will run

    ![Create Environment Modal](/images/configuration/environment/create_environment_2.png)

    <Info>
    Once an environment is provisioned, the cluster assignment cannot be changed.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to finalize the environment setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Services

After creation, you can add services including:
- Applications
- Cronjobs
- Lifecycle jobs
- Databases

## Environment Settings

Access environment settings to configure various aspects of your environment:

![Environment Settings](/images/configuration/environment/environment_settings.png)

### General Tab

Configure basic environment properties:

- **Environment Name**: Update the environment name
- **Environment Mode**: Change between Production, Staging, Development, or Preview

<Info>
The cluster assignment is immutable after the environment is provisioned.
</Info>

### Deployment Rules

Set policies to reduce costs and control deployments. Learn more about [deployment rules](/configuration/deployment/overview) for cost optimization.

### Deployment Pipeline

Configure the deployment pipeline to be executed when a deployment on the environment is triggered. Control how services are deployed within the environment.

Learn more about [deployment pipelines](/configuration/deployment/pipeline).

## Preview Environment

Preview environments are automatically created for pull requests, enabling you to test changes in isolation before merging.

### Creating Preview Environments

Qovery supports two workflows for preview environments:

#### On Demand (Manual)

Developers manually create preview environments when needed by commenting on pull requests.

**Setup**:
1. Enable preview environments in environment settings
2. Configure which services to include
3. Developers comment on PRs to trigger creation

![Preview Environment Flow](/images/configuration/environment/preview_env_flow_ondemand.png)

#### On Every PR (Automatic)

Qovery automatically creates a preview environment for every pull request.

**Setup**:
1. Enable auto-preview in environment settings
2. Select services to deploy automatically
3. Configure auto-delete rules

### Per-Service Activation

You can control which services are included in preview environments at the service level, giving you fine-grained control over what gets deployed.

### Auto-Delete Functionality

Configure automatic cleanup of preview environments:
- When PR is merged
- When PR is closed
- After specified period of inactivity

This helps control costs and keeps your project organized.

## Clone Environment

Duplicate an existing environment to quickly create a copy across projects or clusters:

![Clone Environment](/images/configuration/environment/clone_environment.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Environment">
    Go to the environment you want to clone
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone">
    Click the **Clone** button in environment settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Clone">
    Specify:
    - New environment name
    - Target project (can be different)
    - Target cluster (can be different)
    - Which services to include

    ![Clone Environment Modal](/images/configuration/environment/clone_environment_modal.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Clone">
    Click **Clone Environment** to create the copy
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Cloning excludes:
- Custom domains
- Certain built-in environment variables
</Info>

## Deployment & Deletion

### Deploying an Environment

Deploy all services in an environment through the Qovery Console or CLI. See [deployment management](/configuration/deployment/overview) for details.

### Deleting an Environment

<Warning>
Deleting an environment is a **permanent operation**. All services, databases, and data will be irreversibly deleted.
</Warning>

Before deleting:
1. Backup important data
2. Stop all services
3. Verify you're deleting the correct environment
