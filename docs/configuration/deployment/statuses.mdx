Qovery allows you to track the status of your environments and services through the Qovery Console.

## Running Statuses

The running status indicates if your application is running correctly or not.

### Environment Running Statuses

The environment status is computed from all the services running in the environment:

- **STOPPED**: All services are stopped
- **STARTING**: At least one service is starting
- **STOPPING**: At least one service is stopping
- **RUNNING**: All services are running correctly
- **ERROR**: All services are in error status
- **WARNING**: At least one service is in error status (but not all)

### Service Running Statuses

The service status indicates if the application instances are running correctly:

- **STOPPED**: All instances are stopped
- **STARTING**: At least one instance is starting
- **STOPPING**: At least one instance is stopping
- **RUNNING**: All instances are running correctly
- **ERROR**: All instances are in error status
- **WARNING**: For applications running several instances, at least one instance is in error status (but not all)
- **COMPLETED**: For lifecycle jobs and cron jobs, the job has been executed successfully

### Pod Status

You can view the status of individual Kubernetes pods by clicking on a service in the Service overview page. This shows:

- The number of running instances
- The status of each individual pod
- Error details for pods that are failing

Clicking on a problematic pod will show you the specific reason why it's failing.

## Deployment Statuses

The deployment status indicates the progress of the deployment operation (build and release).

### Deployment Statuses Flow

The deployment follows these statuses:

**Temporary statuses:**
- **QUEUED**: The deployment request is in the queue
- **BUILDING**: The code is being built into a container image (for Git deployments)
- **DEPLOYING**: The container is being deployed to Kubernetes
- **CANCELLING BUILDING**: The build is being cancelled
- **CANCELLED**: The deployment has been cancelled

**Final statuses:**
- **BUILDING ERROR**: The build failed
- **DEPLOYMENT ERROR**: The deployment to Kubernetes failed
- **DEPLOYMENT OK**: The deployment was successful
- **SKIPPED**: The service was excluded from the deployment because it is marked as [skipped](/configuration/deployment/pipeline#skipped-services) in the deployment pipeline

### Important Note

<Note>
Just because an error arose during deployment does not mean your application is not running. The deployment status and the running status are two different things.

For example, if a deployment fails but you already have a previous version running, your application will continue running with the old version. The deployment status will show "DEPLOYMENT ERROR" while the running status may show "RUNNING".
</Note>

This is why it's important to monitor both the deployment status and the running status to have a complete picture of your application's state.
