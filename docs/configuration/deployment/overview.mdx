## Overview

The deployment is the process of creating all the necessary resources to run your applications on your cloud account based on the configuration done on the Qovery console.

## How It Works

Here's the complete deployment flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Code Push">
    A developer commits code to the Git repository
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger">
    The deployment can be triggered in three ways:

    - **Auto-deploy activated**: A webhook automatically triggers the deployment when a commit is pushed
    - **Auto-deploy inactive**: Your CI/CD manages the deployment
    - **Manual trigger**: Deploy manually from the Qovery console
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pipeline Processing">
    The Qovery engine processes your deployment pipeline configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Retrieval">
    The engine pulls the code from your Git repository
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build & Registry">
    The engine builds your code and pushes the container image to your cloud registry
  </Step>

  <Step title="Infrastructure Setup">
    The engine creates the load balancers and configures networking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Kubernetes Deployment">
    The engine creates a Kubernetes namespace and deploys your application
  </Step>

  <Step title="Domain Configuration">
    The engine sets up your custom domain and configures TLS certificates
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
For applications deployed from a container registry, the deployment workflow is modified - the build step is skipped and Qovery directly deploys the pre-built container image.
</Note>

## Monitoring Deployments

As a developer, you can track the deployment through:

- **Deployment Status**: Monitor the deployment and running status of your services
- **Real-time Logs**: Access logs during deployment and while your application is running
- **Deployment History**: Review details of past deployments

Qovery provides you with a complete set of [Deployment Actions](/configuration/deployment/actions) allowing you to manage the deployment lifecycle, including stop and restart functions.
