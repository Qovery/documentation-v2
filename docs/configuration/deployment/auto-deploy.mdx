Qovery can automatically update your applications to the latest version of your Git branch. Each time a commit is done on your Git repository, Qovery will receive a webhook call with the commit information and will determine which applications should be automatically re-deployed.

## Activation

You can activate the auto-deploy flag either within the application settings or during the service creation flow.

![Auto-Deploy Creation Flow](/images/deployment/auto-deploy-creation-flow.png)

Once activated, each commit on the application branch will automatically trigger the deployment of the new version of your application.

## Filtering Commits

The "Deployment restrictions" feature allows you to better control which commits should trigger a new deployment and which should not.

![Deployment Restrictions](/images/deployment/deployment_restrictions.png)

There are two modes:

- **EXCLUDE**: the deployment will be triggered for all commits EXCEPT the one that have changed ONLY the specified files/folders
- **MATCH**: the deployment will be triggered ONLY if the commit has changed the specified files/folders

<Warning>
Important notes:
- The value must be the complete path of the file/folder to be excluded/matched
- The path must NOT start with a forward slash `/`
- Wildcards (`*`) are not supported
- You can use path prefixes for partial matching (e.g., `docs/` will match any file within the docs folder)
</Warning>

## Container Image Auto-Deploy

For container images (not Git repositories), you need to configure your CI/CD pipeline to notify Qovery when a new image tag is available. This can be done through:

- The Qovery API using the `autoDeployContainerEnvironments` endpoint for containers
- The Qovery API using the `autoDeployJobEnvironments` endpoint for lifecycle jobs and cronjobs

See the [API documentation](https://api-doc.qovery.com/) for more details.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I exclude commits from triggering a deployment?">
    Yes, you can use the "Deployment restrictions" feature with EXCLUDE mode to specify files or folders that should not trigger deployments when they are the only changes in a commit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will a stopped service be restarted if auto-deploy is active?">
    No, auto-deploy will not restart a stopped service. The service must be running for auto-deploy to trigger a deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is mono-repository supported?">
    Yes, mono-repositories are fully supported. You can have multiple services connected to the same Git repository. Use the "Deployment restrictions" feature with MATCH mode to limit auto-deploy triggers to specific subfolders for each service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Qovery automatically check the container registry for new image tags?">
    No, Qovery does not automatically monitor container registries. You must notify Qovery when a new image tag is available through:
    - The Qovery Console
    - The Qovery CLI using `qovery deploy --tag <tag-name>`
    - The Qovery API endpoints (`autoDeployContainerEnvironments` or `autoDeployJobEnvironments`)
