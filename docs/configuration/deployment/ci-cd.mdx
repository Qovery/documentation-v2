Once you have configured your environments and services, you can manage deployments through the Qovery web console UI or directly from your CI/CD pipeline.

## CI/CD Integration

Qovery provides comprehensive CI/CD integration capabilities, allowing you to trigger deployments from your existing continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows.

### Why Use CI/CD with Qovery?

## Integration Methods

Qovery supports multiple methods for CI/CD integration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Qovery CLI">
    Use the Qovery CLI in your CI/CD pipelines to trigger deployments programmatically.

    ```bash
    # Install Qovery CLI
    curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash

    # Authenticate
    qovery auth --token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN

    # Set context
    qovery context set

    # Deploy application
    qovery application deploy
    ```

    <Info>
    The Qovery CLI is the recommended method for CI/CD integration. It provides a simple, declarative interface for all deployment operations.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Qovery API">
    Use the Qovery REST API to integrate deployments into any CI/CD system.

    ```bash
    # Trigger deployment via API
    curl -X POST \
      "https://api.qovery.com/application/$APPLICATION_ID/deploy" \
      -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

    <Info>
    The Qovery API provides full control over all platform features. See the [API documentation](/api-reference/introduction) for complete details.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub Actions">
    Use the official Qovery GitHub Actions for seamless GitHub integration.

    ```yaml
    name: Deploy to Qovery
    on:
      push:
        branches: [main]

    jobs:
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Deploy to Qovery
            uses: Qovery/qovery-action@v1
            with:
              qovery-api-token: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_API_TOKEN }}
              qovery-organization-id: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_ORG_ID }}
              qovery-application-id: ${{ secrets.QOVERY_APP_ID }}
    ```

    <Info>
    See the complete [GitHub Actions integration guide](/integrations/ci-cd/github-actions) for more details.

## Common CI/CD Patterns

### Pattern 1: Build, Test, Deploy

The most common pattern is to build your application, run tests, and then deploy to Qovery if tests pass.

```yaml
# Example with GitHub Actions
jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to Qovery
        if: success()
        run: |
          qovery auth --token ${{ secrets.QOVERY_API_TOKEN }}
          qovery application deploy
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Environment Deployment

Deploy to different environments based on branch or tag:

```yaml
# Deploy to staging on develop branch
- name: Deploy to Staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: |
    qovery context set --environment staging
    qovery application deploy

# Deploy to production on main branch
- name: Deploy to Production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: |
    qovery context set --environment production
    qovery application deploy
```

### Pattern 3: Container Image Deployment

Build your own container image and deploy it to Qovery:

```yaml
# Build and push image, then notify Qovery
- name: Build and push Docker image
  run: |
    docker build -t myregistry.com/myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
    docker push myregistry.com/myapp:${{ github.sha }}

- name: Deploy to Qovery
  run: |
    qovery application update --image myregistry.com/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    qovery application deploy
```

## Authentication

To integrate Qovery with your CI/CD pipeline, you need to authenticate using an API token.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    Go to your Qovery account settings and generate a new API token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Token Securely">
    Add the token to your CI/CD platform's secrets management (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Token in Pipeline">
    Reference the token in your pipeline configuration without exposing it in logs
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Never commit API tokens directly in your repository. Always use your CI/CD platform's secrets management.
</Warning>

## Deployment Strategies with CI/CD

When using CI/CD, you can implement advanced deployment strategies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blue-Green Deployments">
    Deploy to a new environment (green) while keeping the current environment (blue) running. Switch traffic once the new deployment is validated.

    ```bash
    # Deploy to green environment
    qovery context set --environment green
    qovery application deploy

    # Run smoke tests
    npm run smoke-tests

    # Switch traffic if tests pass
    qovery environment update --routing green
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Canary Deployments">
    Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users before full deployment.

    ```bash
    # Deploy new version with 10% traffic
    qovery application deploy --canary 10

    # Monitor metrics
    sleep 300

    # Increase to 50% if healthy
    qovery application deploy --canary 50

    # Full rollout
    qovery application deploy --canary 100
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rollback on Failure">
    Automatically rollback deployments if health checks fail.

    ```bash
    # Deploy new version
    qovery application deploy

    # Run health checks
    if ! ./scripts/health-check.sh; then
      echo "Health check failed, rolling back"
      qovery application rollback
      exit 1
    fi
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
