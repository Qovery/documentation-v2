Qovery provides you with the logs of your deployments and services through the Qovery Console.

## Two Types of Logs

Qovery provides you with two types of logs:

1. **Deployment logs**: Every time a deployment is triggered, Qovery provides you with the log of its execution and the errors if any
2. **Service logs**: Real-time logs of your application streamed directly from your application (not stored on Qovery's infrastructure)

## How to Access Logs

You can access logs from three different entry points in the Qovery Console:

![Access Logs](/images/deployment/access_logs.png)

1. **Scroll icon** next to the service: Access the service logs (runtime logs from your application)
2. **Pipeline icon**: Access the deployment pipeline view showing all stages of the deployment
3. **Deployment status label**: Access the deployment logs for a specific deployment

## Pipeline View

The pipeline view provides a centralized overview of your deployment process, showing all deployment stages including pre-check validations.

**Features:**
- Stage-by-stage visibility of deployment phases
- Pre-check logs for validation processes
- Direct access to specific deployment logs per service
- Automatic filtering of services not involved in the deployment

## Deployment Logs

By default, the deployment logs view shows the most recent deployment execution.

**What's included:**
- Build logs when Qovery CI pipeline builds your service
- Deployment status updates during Kubernetes execution
- Final success/failure confirmation with issue guidance

You can access historical deployments through the "Deployment log switch" or the Deployment history tab.

<Note>
Qovery retains logs for **the last 20 deployments executed** plus the latest failure.

## Service Logs (Live Logs)

Real-time application logs are streamed directly from your running applications.

Each log entry displays:
- **Timestamp**: When the log was generated
- **Pod name**: Which instance generated the log (filterable for multi-instance applications)
- **Version**: Commit ID or image tag
- **Container**: Container name
- **Message**: The actual log content

### Filtering Logs

![Filtered Logs](/images/deployment/live_logs_filtered.png)

You can filter logs using:
- **Search by keyword**: Locate specific messages
- **Filter by time range**: Isolate specific periods
- **Filter by log level**: Prioritize by severity
- **Filter by pod**: View logs from specific instances

## Log Retention

Log retention depends on whether you have an observability package enabled:

| Feature | With Observability Package | Without Package |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **History** | 12 weeks complete | 24 hours maximum |
| **Volume** | Unlimited lines | Latest 1000 lines per service |
| **Capabilities** | Advanced filtering & metrics | Real-time only |

Configuration is available through cluster advanced settings.

## Nginx Logs

For publicly exposed applications, Nginx logs are also accessible through the same interface, displaying request management information.
