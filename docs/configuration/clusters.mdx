Once your cluster is created, the cluster card displays comprehensive information about your cluster's configuration and health:

**Cluster Details:**
- Deployed nodes and their current statuses
- Instance type configuration (min/max instances)
- Reserved resources: CPU, memory, and disk capacity
- Current Kubernetes version with upgrade warnings if applicable
- Last deployment timestamp and status
- Karpenter nodepool grouping (if using Karpenter)
- Per-node resource allocation

### Statuses

Qovery tracks cluster health using two status categories:

#### Cluster Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| <Icon icon="circle-check" iconType="solid" color="green" /> **Running** | Cluster is healthy and operational |
| <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" color="yellow" /> **Warning** | Minor issues detected, requires attention |
| <Icon icon="circle-xmark" iconType="solid" color="red" /> **Error** | Critical issues, intervention required |
| <Icon icon="circle" iconType="regular" color="gray" /> **Status unavailable** | Cluster unreachable or offline |

#### Deployment Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Deployment Queued** | Deployment is waiting in the queue |
| **Deploying** | Deployment is currently in progress |
| **Last Deployment Failed** | The most recent deployment encountered errors |
| **Last Deployment Succeeded** | The most recent deployment completed successfully |

### Performing Actions on Clusters

Available cluster operations and their cloud provider compatibility:

| Action | AWS | Azure | GCP | Scaleway | Description |
|--------|-----|-------|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Update** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Redeploy cluster after configuration changes |
| **Stop** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Temporarily pause cluster (provider charges may still apply) |
| **Restart** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Resume a stopped cluster |
| **Delete** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Permanently remove cluster |

To perform an action:
1. Navigate to your cluster page
2. Click the action dropdown menu
3. Select the desired action
4. Track progress through cluster logs

#### Updating a Cluster

Redeploys your cluster after making configuration changes through the Qovery Console or API.

#### Stopping a Cluster

Temporarily pauses your cluster to reduce costs.

<Warning>
Some cloud provider charges may continue even when the cluster is stopped (e.g., storage, reserved IPs, load balancers).
</Warning>

#### Restarting a Cluster

Resumes a stopped cluster and redeploys all services.

#### Deleting a Cluster

Permanently removes your cluster. You have three deletion options:

1. **Default (Recommended)**: Complete cleanup
   - Deletes all Qovery-managed resources
   - Removes cloud provider infrastructure
   - No residual costs

2. **Delete on cloud provider and Qovery configuration**: Manual database handling
   - Deletes cluster from cloud provider
   - Removes Qovery configuration
   - Requires manual database cleanup

3. **Delete Qovery configuration only**: Keep cloud resources
   - Removes Qovery management only
   - Cloud infrastructure continues running
   - Continue managing manually in cloud console

<Warning>
Cluster deletion is **permanent and irreversible**. Ensure you have backups before proceeding.
</Warning>

#### Additional Actions

**Audit Logs:**
- Access complete cluster activity history
- Track configuration changes and deployments
- Available for compliance and troubleshooting

**Cluster ID:**
- Retrieve unique cluster identifier
- Required for API operations and support tickets

**Kubeconfig:**
- Download Kubernetes configuration file
- Enable direct kubectl access
- Use for advanced debugging and management

<Warning>
**Security Best Practice**: Kubeconfig provides cluster-admin access. Store securely and never commit to version control.
</Warning>

## Logs

Access cluster logs for troubleshooting and monitoring:

1. Navigate to your cluster page
2. Click **Logs** or **View Logs**
3. Use the tab system to view:
   - **Cluster Info**: General cluster information
   - **Error Details**: Specific error messages and stack traces

## Custom Domain and Wildcard TLS (Beta)

By default, Qovery assigns a subdomain under `qovery.io` to your cluster services. However, Let's Encrypt rate limits may affect certificate issuance.

To use your own custom domain with wildcard TLS certificates, Qovery supports **Cloudflare** integration.

### Requirements

- A domain managed by Cloudflare
- Cloudflare API token with specific permissions

### Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Cloudflare API Token">
    1. Log into your Cloudflare account
    2. Go to **My Profile** → **API Tokens**
    3. Click **Create Token**
    4. Use the **Edit zone DNS** template or create a custom token
    5. Grant these permissions:
       - Zone → DNS → Edit
       - Zone → Zone → Read
    6. Set Zone Resources to include your domain
    7. Create and copy the token
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure in Qovery">
    1. Navigate to your cluster settings
    2. Find the **Custom Domain** section
    3. Enter your domain (e.g., `example.com`)
    4. Paste your Cloudflare API token
    5. Save configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update DNS">
    Qovery will provide DNS records to add to your Cloudflare account
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This feature is currently in **Beta**. Additional DNS providers will be supported in future releases.
</Info>

## AWS Account Cleanup

If cluster deletion fails or leaves resources behind, you can manually clean up using AWS Console tags.

### Manual Cleanup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open AWS Console">
    Navigate to the [AWS Resource Groups & Tag Editor](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for Qovery Resources">
    1. Select **All supported resource types**
    2. Add tag filter: `ClusterId` or `QoveryCluster`
    3. Search for resources
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Delete">
    1. Review the list of tagged resources
    2. Manually delete each resource through AWS Console
    3. Common resources to check:
       - EC2 instances
       - EKS clusters
       - VPCs and networking components
       - Load balancers
       - EBS volumes
       - Security groups
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuration/clusters/aws-console-cluster-cleanup.jpg" alt="AWS Console Cleanup" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
Manual cleanup should only be performed if automatic Qovery deletion fails. Always verify resources before deletion to avoid data loss.
</Warning>
