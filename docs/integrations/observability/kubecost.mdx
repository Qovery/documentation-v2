Kubecost provides real-time cost visibility and insights for your Kubernetes clusters. This guide shows you how to deploy Kubecost on your Qovery cluster to track and optimize your infrastructure spending.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: You need a functioning Qovery cluster before starting this tutorial.

<Info>
This tutorial takes approximately **3 minutes** to complete.

## Step 1. Add the Kubecost Helm Repository

Add the Kubecost Helm repository in Qovery:

1. Go to your **Organization** settings
2. Select **Helm Repositories**
3. Click **Add Repository**
4. Enter the repository details:
   - **Name**: Kubecost
   - **Repository URL**: `https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/`
5. Click **Create**

## Step 2. Deploy the Kubecost Helm Chart

Create a new Helm service in your environment:

1. Navigate to your **Environment**
2. Click **Create** → **Helm**
3. Configure the Helm service:
   - **Service name**: kubecost
   - **Source**: Kubecost (the repository you just added)
   - **Chart name**: `cost-analyzer`
   - **Chart version**: `1.108.0`
   - **Allow cluster-wide resources**: Enable

4. **(Optional)** If you have a Kubecost token:
   - Create an environment variable named `KUBECOST_TOKEN`
   - Set it as **Secret**
   - Enter your token value

5. If using a token, add this in the **Values override** section:
   ```yaml
   kubecostToken: qovery.env.KUBECOST_TOKEN
   ```

6. Click **Create** and wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 3. Expose Kubecost

To access the Kubecost interface, you need to expose it publicly:

1. Once deployed, check the **Deployment logs** to find the service name

<img src="/images/kubecost/service-name.png" alt="Service name" />

The service name will be something like: `helm-z325f0565-kubecost-cost-analyzer`

2. Go to your Helm service **Settings** → **Port**
3. Click **Add Port**

<img src="/images/kubecost/add-port.png" alt="Add port" />

4. Configure the port:
   - **Service name**: The service name from step 1 (e.g., `helm-z325f0565-kubecost-cost-analyzer`)
   - **Service port**: `9090`
   - **Protocol**: `HTTP`
   - **Publicly exposed**: Enable

5. Click **Create**

6. After redeployment, you'll see a public link to access Kubecost

## Conclusion

You've successfully deployed Kubecost on your Qovery cluster. You can now access the Kubecost dashboard to monitor your Kubernetes costs and get optimization recommendations.
