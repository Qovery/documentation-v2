In addition to real-time monitoring, Qovery observability includes **logs** to help you understand what happened in your applications.

## Service Logs

Every service in Qovery has its own log stream, collected and stored via **Loki + Promtail**.

**Key Features:**
- **Full historical access**: Complete log history with **12 weeks retention** when observability is enabled, or 24 hours without it
- Logs are enriched with **Qovery-specific labels** such as service ID and environment ID for easier filtering
- Error-level logs are automatically detected and counted, making it easy to correlate metrics with log spikes

<Info>
See the [Deployment Logs](/configuration/deployment/logs) section to learn more about real-time log streaming during deployments.

## Log Navigation

From the Monitoring tab:

1. **Quick error detection**: You can quickly spot if error logs occurred within the selected time range
2. **Jump to logs**: Click on the scroll icon next to the error logs to jump into the Service Logs view
3. **Pre-filtered view**: The logs interface will already be filtered on the right service, severity, and selected time range

## Log Retention

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="With Observability Enabled">
    **12 weeks retention**

    When Qovery Observability is enabled on your cluster, all service logs are retained for 12 weeks, giving you comprehensive historical access for debugging and analysis.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Without Observability">
    **24 hours retention**

    Without observability enabled, logs are retained for 24 hours only. This is sufficient for real-time debugging but limited for historical analysis.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Log Filtering

Use Qovery-specific labels to filter logs:
- **Service ID**: Filter logs by specific service
- **Environment ID**: View logs from a particular environment
- **Severity Level**: Filter by log level (info, warning, error, etc.)
- **Time Range**: Select custom time ranges for analysis

<Tip>
Enable Qovery Observability on your cluster to unlock 12-week log retention and advanced log analytics capabilities.
