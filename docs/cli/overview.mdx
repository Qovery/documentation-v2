## Overview

The Qovery CLI (Command Line Interface) enables you to interact with Qovery directly from your terminal. Deploy applications, manage environments, stream logs, and more - all without leaving your command line.

## Installation

### macOS

Install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap qovery/qovery-cli
brew install qovery-cli
```

### Linux

```bash
curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

### Windows

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-cli/releases) and add it to your PATH.

### Verify Installation

```bash
qovery version
```

## Authentication

Before using the CLI, you need to authenticate:

```bash
qovery auth
```

This will open a browser window for authentication. Once completed, you'll be ready to use the CLI.

### API Token Authentication

You can also authenticate using an API token:

```bash
export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-api-token"
qovery auth
```

Generate an API token from the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/api-tokens).

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.qovery/context.json`. You can manage multiple contexts for different organizations or clusters.

### Set Default Context

```bash
qovery context set
```

### List Contexts

```bash
qovery context list
```
