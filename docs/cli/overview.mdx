```

## Authentication

Before using the CLI, you need to authenticate:

qovery auth

This will open a browser window for authentication. Once completed, you'll be ready to use the CLI.

### API Token Authentication

You can also authenticate using an API token:

```bash
export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-api-token"
qovery auth
```

Generate an API token from the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com/platform/organization/api-tokens).

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.qovery/context.json`. You can manage multiple contexts for different organizations or clusters.

### Set Default Context

qovery context set
```

### List Contexts

```
