The Qovery Slack Bot brings AI Copilot capabilities directly into your Slack workspace, allowing you and your team to manage infrastructure through natural language commands in Slack channels.

<Note>
**Early Access Required**: The Qovery Slack Bot is available online and on demand. Contact [Qovery Support](mailto:support@qovery.com) to request early access.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Beta Status**: The Qovery Slack Bot is currently in beta. Features and capabilities are being actively developed.
</Warning>

## Operating Modes

The Slack Bot supports both operating modes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read-Only Mode (Default)">
    **Default behavior** - Safe for exploration

    The Slack Bot starts in **read-only mode** by default, allowing you to:
    - View information and status
    - Get help and recommendations
    - Troubleshoot issues
    - Monitor deployments
    - **No changes** to infrastructure

    This ensures safe exploration without risk of accidental modifications.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Read-Write Mode">
    **Full automation** - When you need to take action

    When needed, the Slack Bot can operate in **read-write mode** to:
    - Deploy applications and services
    - Create new environments
    - Update configurations
    - Add/modify/delete environment variables
    - Scale, restart, or stop services
    - Delete resources (with confirmation)

    <Warning>
    The Copilot will **ask for confirmation** before performing destructive operations like deletions.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Slack bot, ensure you have:

- **Qovery Account**: Active account with infrastructure deployed
- **Slack Workspace**: Admin access to install apps
- **API Token**: You'll generate this during setup

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Token">
    1. Go to [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com/)
    2. Click your profile icon (bottom left corner)
    3. Select the correct organization
    4. Navigate to **API Tokens**
    5. Click **Create Token** and give it a descriptive name
    6. Copy the generated token (it will only be shown once)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Bot">
    1. Open a **Direct Message** with the Qovery bot in Slack
    2. Use the command:

    ```
    /qovery-token <your-api-token> <channel-id>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```
    /qovery-token qov_abc123xyz456 C09M85XK3GQ
    ```

    <Info>
    Replace `<your-api-token>` with your actual API token and `<channel-id>` with your Slack channel ID.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Using Copilot">
    Go to your configured channel and start interacting with Qovery AI Copilot!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding Your Channel ID

To find your Slack channel ID:

1. Right-click on the channel name in Slack
2. Select **View channel details**
3. Scroll to the bottom
4. Copy the **Channel ID**

Alternatively, the channel ID is visible in the URL when viewing the channel in a browser:
```
https://app.slack.com/client/T123ABC/C09M85XK3GQ
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                        Channel ID
```

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Privacy" icon="shield">
    **Your API token stays private:**
    - Tokens are configured via Direct Message (DM) with the bot
    - Only you see your token in the DM
    - The token is never exposed in public channels

    **Access for team members:**
    - Once configured, all members of the channel can use the bot
    - Team members don't need their own tokens
    - The bot uses your configured token to perform actions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best Practices" icon="lock">
    - **Use dedicated tokens**: Create a specific token for the Slack bot
    - **Set appropriate permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions to the token
    - **Rotate regularly**: Update tokens periodically for security
    - **Monitor usage**: Review audit logs for bot activities
    - **Revoke if needed**: Delete tokens immediately if compromised
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Channel Access" icon="users">
    - Configure the bot for specific channels only
    - All channel members can use the bot once configured
    - Actions are performed with the configured token's permissions
    - Consider using separate tokens for different channels/teams
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using the Slack Bot

### Basic Commands

Interact with the bot using natural language in your configured channel:

**Read-only commands** (default, always safe):
```
@qovery Show me all production environments
@qovery What's the status of the database?
@qovery List all applications in the dev environment
@qovery Show me recent deployment history
```

**Read-write commands** (when you need to take action):
```
@qovery Deploy the api-service to staging
@qovery Restart the frontend application
@qovery Scale the api to 3 replicas
@qovery Add environment variable API_KEY=xxx to production
```

<Note>
The bot will **confirm destructive actions** before executing them in read-write mode.
</Note>

## Team Collaboration

### Multi-User Access

Once configured, the bot enables team collaboration:

- **Shared visibility**: All team members see bot responses
- **Collaborative debugging**: Multiple people can investigate issues together
- **Faster response**: Anyone can trigger deployments or check status
- **Knowledge sharing**: Team learns from each other's interactions

### Channel Organization

Consider organizing channels by:

- **Environment**: #prod-ops, #staging-ops, #dev-ops
- **Team**: #platform-team, #backend-team, #frontend-team
- **Purpose**: #deployments, #incidents, #monitoring

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not responding">
    **Check:**
    1. Token is correctly configured for the channel
    2. Token hasn't expired or been revoked
    3. You're mentioning the bot (@qovery) in messages
    4. The channel ID is correct

    **Solution:** Reconfigure with `/qovery-token` command in DM
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    **Issue:** Bot says it can't perform an action

    **Check:**
    1. API token has necessary permissions
    2. You have access to the resources in Qovery
    3. Resources exist and names are correct

    **Solution:** Create a new token with appropriate permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bot installed but can't configure">
    **Check:**
    1. You're sending `/qovery-token` in a Direct Message (not a channel)
    2. Token format is correct (no extra spaces)
    3. Channel ID is valid

    **Solution:** Double-check command format and try again in DM
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
