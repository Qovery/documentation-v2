</Frame>

### The Copilot Panel

Once opened, the Copilot appears as a side panel on the right side of the console:

- **Contextual awareness**: Automatically knows what page and environment you're viewing
- **Suggested actions**: Pre-populated questions based on your current context
- **Chat interface**: Natural language interaction with your infrastructure
- **System status**: Shows operational status at the bottom

## Contextual Suggestions

The Copilot provides contextual suggestions based on where you are in the console:

### Environment Page Suggestions

When viewing an environment, you'll see suggestions like:

- **"What is an environment?"** - Learn about environment concepts
- **"Monitor the running and deployment status of your environments and services"** - Check current status
- **"How do I manage the deployment order of my services?"** - Configure deployment pipelines
- **"Manage the deployment lifecycle of your services and environments"** - Control deployments
- **"Check my deployments and application logs"** - Investigate issues

### Service-Specific Context

The Copilot automatically knows:
- Which environment you're viewing
- Which services are deployed
- Current deployment status
- Recent errors or issues

## Using the Console Copilot

### Ask Questions

Simply type your question in natural language:

```
How do I deploy this application?
Why is my Frontend service showing an error?
What's the status of my PostgreSQL database?
How do I add environment variables?
```

### Get Contextual Help

The Copilot provides answers specific to your current context:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Environment Questions">
    **You ask:** "What services are running?"

    **Copilot responds:** Based on your current environment "Julien dev", you have:
    - Frontend (Error)
    - Grafana (Stopped)
    - PostgreSQL (Starting)
    - My service (Error)
    - And 4 more services...
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Troubleshooting">
    **You ask:** "Why is Frontend failing?"

    **Copilot responds:** Analyzing the Frontend service in your environment, I can see:
    - Last deployment aborted
    - Check the deployment logs for specific errors
    - Common causes include: build failures, missing environment variables...
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration Help">
    **You ask:** "How do I add a database?"

    **Copilot responds:** To add a database to your "Julien dev" environment:
    1. Click "New service" button
    2. Select "Database"
    3. Choose your database type...
  </Tab>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copilot Updates Context">
    The Copilot immediately becomes aware of the new environment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relevant Suggestions Appear">
    Contextual suggestions update to match the new environment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Indicator">

</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about your context" icon="bullseye">
    While the Copilot knows your current environment, being specific helps:

    **Instead of:** "Why is it failing?"

    **Try:** "Why is the Frontend service deployment failing?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use suggested questions" icon="lightbulb">
    The contextual suggestions are tailored to common tasks:
    - Click on a suggested question to get started
    - They're designed for your current page context
    - Great for learning what's possible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask follow-up questions" icon="comments">
    Build on previous answers:

    1. "What services are in error state?"
    2. "Show me logs for the Frontend service"
    3. "How do I fix this deployment error?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use keyboard shortcuts" icon="keyboard">
    Speed up your workflow:
    - `⌘ I` (Mac) or `Ctrl I` (Windows/Linux) to open
    - Type your question and press Enter
    - ESC to close the panel
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
