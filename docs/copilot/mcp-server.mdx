## Overview

The Qovery MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables you to use Qovery AI Copilot directly in any MCP-compatible client, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Claude Code. This gives you natural language control over your entire Qovery infrastructure.

<Note>
**Activation Required**: Before using the MCP Server, organization administrators must first activate Qovery AI Copilot from the console settings. See the [Getting Started guide](/copilot/getting-started#activation) for activation instructions.
</Note>

<Info>
**What is MCP?** The Model Context Protocol is an open standard developed by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and systems. [Learn more →](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
</Info>

## Operating Modes

The MCP Server's operating mode is determined by your organization's AI Copilot settings and your API token's permissions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read-Only Mode">
    **Safe exploration** - View-only access

    In **read-only mode**, the Copilot allows you to:
    - View information and status
    - Get help and recommendations
    - Troubleshoot issues
    - Monitor deployments
    - Analyze infrastructure
    - **No changes** to infrastructure

    This ensures safe exploration without risk of accidental modifications.
    
    <Info>
    Read-only mode is active when your organization has disabled AI write permissions, or when your API token has viewer-level permissions.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Read-Write Mode">
    **Full automation** - Maximum capabilities

    In **read-write mode**, the Copilot can perform complete automation:
    - Deploy applications and services
    - Create new environments and resources
    - Update configurations and settings
    - Add/modify/delete environment variables
    - Scale, restart, or stop services
    - Delete resources (with confirmation)
    - Execute complex workflows

    <Warning>
    The Copilot will **ask for confirmation** before performing destructive operations like deletions.
    </Warning>
    
    <Info>
    Read-write mode requires both:
    1. AI write permissions enabled in your organization settings
    2. An API token with sufficient permissions (Developer or Admin role)
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Permission Hierarchy**: The MCP Server operates at the highest level of access available based on:
- Your organization's AI Copilot authorization settings (read-only or read-write)
- Your API token's role permissions

The most restrictive setting takes precedence. For example, if your organization enables AI write access but your token has viewer permissions, the Copilot will operate in read-only mode.

**Note**: The operating mode applies to all your conversations. If you have read-write access, your conversations will operate in read-write mode.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before using the MCP Server:

- **MCP-Compatible Client**: Any MCP-compatible application (tested with ChatGPT, Claude, and Claude Code)
- **Qovery Account**: Active account with infrastructure
- **API Token**: Generate from Qovery Console (Settings → API Tokens)

## Setup

### 1. Generate Your Qovery API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Qovery Console">
    Go to [console.qovery.com](https://console.qovery.com)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click on the settings icon in your organization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access API Tokens">
    Go to **API Tokens** section
  </Step>

 <Step title="Generate Token">
    Click "Generate Token" and copy it

    <Warning>
    Save this token securely. You won't be able to see it again!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

The Qovery MCP Server is accessible via the following URL:

```
https://mcp-api-ai.qovery.com/mcp
```

You can optionally include your API token as a query parameter:

```
https://mcp-api-ai.qovery.com/mcp?token=<your-token>
```

<Info>
**Token in URL**: If you provide the token in the URL, you won't be prompted for authentication during the session. If omitted, the token will be requested when you first interact with the server.
</Info>

Add the Qovery MCP Server to your MCP client's configuration using:

```
Server URL: https://mcp-api-ai.qovery.com/mcp
```

Refer to your specific MCP client's documentation for detailed setup instructions on how to add a custom MCP server.

<Info>
The Qovery MCP Server is also available through the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=com.qovery).
</Info>

## Usage

### Authentication with API Token

The Qovery MCP Server supports **3 authentication methods**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Query Parameter">
    Add your token directly to the MCP Server URL:
    ```
    https://mcp-api-ai.qovery.com/mcp?token=your_qovery_token
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="2. Custom Header">
    Add the `X-Qovery-Token` header to your requests:
    ```
    X-Qovery-Token: your_qovery_token
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="3. Authorization Header">
    Use the standard `Authorization` header:
    ```
    Authorization: Token your_qovery_token
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Usage Examples

Once authenticated, you can interact with your infrastructure naturally:

### Check Status

```
"Show me all my environments"
"What's the status of production?"
"List applications in the staging environment"
```

### Deploy Applications

```
"Deploy the latest version of my-api to production"
"Restart the frontend application"
"Scale the API service to 5 replicas"
```

### Troubleshoot Issues

```
"Why is my deployment failing?"
"Show me error logs from the last hour"
"Debug the connection timeout in staging"
```

### Manage Infrastructure

```
"Create a new environment called feature-test"
"Clone production to staging"
"Stop all services in the dev environment"
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting

**Issue**: Client doesn't show Qovery tools or cannot connect

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the MCP Server URL is correct: `https://mcp-api-ai.qovery.com/mcp`
2. Check your internet connection
3. Restart your MCP client
4. Contact Qovery Support if the issue persists

### Authentication Errors

**Issue**: "Authentication failed" or "Invalid token" errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API token is correct (check for copy-paste errors)
2. Ensure the token hasn't been revoked or expired
3. Verify the token has the necessary permissions for the requested operation
4. Generate a new API token if needed from Qovery Console

### Token Not Persisting

**Issue**: Need to re-enter token for each question

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're staying in the same conversation
2. Provide the token at the beginning of new conversations
3. Check if your client is maintaining the conversation context

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**API Token Security**:
- Never share your API tokens publicly
- Don't commit tokens to version control
- Revoke tokens you no longer need from Qovery Console
- Use tokens with the minimum required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly
</Warning>

### Token Permissions

The API token has the same permissions as the role you selected during creation:
- Can only access resources within your organization
- Respects organization RBAC policies
- All actions are audited in Qovery Console
