## Overview

Qovery AI Copilot is your intelligent assistant for managing infrastructure. It's available through three interfaces: the **Console** (built-in), **Slack Bot** (team collaboration), and **MCP Server** (power users). All allow you to interact with your Qovery infrastructure using natural language.

## Operating Modes

The Qovery AI Copilot operates in two modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Read-Only Mode (Default)" icon="eye">
    **Safe exploration and information access**

    - View information and status
    - Get help and recommendations
    - Troubleshoot issues
    - Learn about features
    - **Cannot make changes** to infrastructure

    **Available in:** Console (only), Slack Bot, MCP Server
  </Card>

  <Card title="Read-Write Mode" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Full automation capabilities**

    - Everything in read-only mode
    - Deploy and restart services
    - Create/modify/delete resources
    - Update configurations
    - Manage environment variables

    **Available in:** Slack Bot, MCP Server (not Console)
  </Card>

## Your First Interactions

### Check Infrastructure Status

```
"Show me all my environments"
"What's the status of production?"
"List all applications in staging environment"
```

### Deploy Applications

```
"Deploy the latest version of my-api to staging"
"Redeploy the frontend application"
"Stop all services in the dev environment"
```

### Investigate Issues

```
"Why is my application deployment failing?"
"Show me error logs from the last hour"
"Check if the database is running"
```

## Understanding How Copilot Works

### Natural Language Understanding

Qovery AI Copilot understands natural language requests:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Casual Language">
    ✅ "Can you deploy my app?"
    ✅ "Stop everything in dev"
    ✅ "Show me what's broken"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Technical Language">
    ✅ "Deploy application-id xyz123 to environment prod"
    ✅ "Scale the API service to 5 replicas"
    ✅ "Update DATABASE_URL environment variable"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mixed Approach">
    ✅ "Deploy the payment-api (commit abc123) to production"
    ✅ "Clone staging to a new environment called feature-test"
    ✅ "Investigate 500 errors in the logs"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Context Awareness

Copilot maintains conversation context:

```
You: "Show me the production environment"
Copilot: [Displays production details]

You: "Clone it to staging-test"
Copilot: [Creates clone without asking which environment]

You: "Now deploy version 2.0 there"
Copilot: [Deploys to staging-test automatically]
```

### Autonomous Execution

For complex tasks, Copilot breaks them down and executes automatically:

**Your Request**: "Create a staging environment for the new feature"

**Copilot's Actions**:
1. Creates new environment
2. Configures networking
3. Sets up databases
4. Deploys applications
5. Validates everything is running
6. Reports success

## Best Practices

### Be Specific When Needed

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ✅ "Deploy my-api to production"
    ✅ "Scale the database in staging"
    ✅ "Show logs for the last 30 minutes"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Can Be Improved">
    ⚠️ "Deploy something" (which app?)
    ⚠️ "Fix the error" (which error?)
    ⚠️ "Make it faster" (which service?)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If Copilot needs more information, it will ask clarifying questions.

### Use Follow-Up Questions

Build on previous interactions:

```
You: "Show me production resources"
Copilot: [Shows resources]

You: "Which ones are using the most CPU?"
Copilot: [Analyzes and reports]

You: "Scale up the top one by 2x"
Copilot: [Scales the identified service]
```

### Leverage Agentic Capabilities

Let Copilot handle complex workflows:

**Instead of**:
```
1. "Show me all environments"
2. "Check which ones are inactive"
3. "Calculate cost savings"
4. "Stop the inactive ones"
```

**Just ask**:
```
"Stop all environments that have been inactive for more than 24 hours"
```

Copilot will plan and execute all steps autonomously.

## Safety & Guardrails

### Confirmation for Destructive Actions

Copilot will ask for confirmation before:

- Deleting environments or services
- Stopping production workloads
- Making infrastructure changes

### Respects Permissions

Copilot can only perform actions you're authorized to do:

- Uses your Qovery credentials
- Follows RBAC policies
- Cannot bypass security controls

### Audit Trail

All Copilot actions are logged:

- View in Qovery Console audit logs
- Track what was changed and when
- Identify which actions Copilot performed

## Common Use Cases

### Daily Operations

```
"Show me the status of all services"
"Deploy the latest commit to staging"
"Restart the API service"
"Check database connection"
```

### Troubleshooting

```
"Why is my deployment failing?"
"Investigate errors in production"
"Show me logs for pod xyz123"
"Debug the connection timeout"
```

### Cost Optimization

```
"Show me which services cost the most"
"Find underutilized resources"
"Stop non-production environments for the weekend"
"Analyze spending over the last month"
```

### Infrastructure Management

```
"Create a new staging environment"
"Clone production to a test environment"
"Update environment variables for all services"
"Scale up the database"
```

## Getting Help

If you're unsure what Copilot can do:

```
"What can you help me with?"
"Show me examples of what you can do"
"Help me troubleshoot an issue"
```

Copilot will provide guidance and suggestions.

## Limitations (Beta)

Current limitations while in beta:

- **Console is Read-Only**: Console Copilot operates permanently in read-only mode for safety
- **Default Mode is Read-Only**: Slack Bot and MCP Server default to read-only mode
- **Confirmation Required**: Destructive operations require user confirmation in read-write mode
- **Beta Features**: Some capabilities still being developed
- **Response Time**: Complex operations may take time
