## Overview

API tokens allow third-party applications or scripts to access your organization via the Qovery API (CI/CD, Terraform, Pulumi, etc.).

You can manage API tokens attached to your organization directly from the Qovery Console or using the [Qovery CLI](/cli/commands/token).

## Accessing API Tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Organization Settings">
    Click the "Wheel" button (⚙️) on the left navigation bar

  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Token API Section">
    Open the `Token API` section within the organization settings

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a New Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Button">
    Press the `Add` button to create a new API token
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Token">
    Provide the following information:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for the token
    - **Description**: Purpose or usage details
    - **Role**: Select a role managed via the [Qovery RBAC system](/configuration/organization/members-rbac)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Token">
    After creation, the token will be displayed once
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important**: Safely store the token returned by the UI. You won't be able to retrieve it again after closing the dialog.
</Warning>

## Delete a Token

To remove an API token:

1. Locate the token in the Token API list
2. Click the **Bin** icon next to the token
3. Confirm the deletion

<Info>
Deleting a token immediately revokes access for any applications or scripts using it.
</Info>

## Edit a Token

<Note>
This functionality is not yet available. To modify a token, you'll need to delete the existing one and create a new token.
</Note>

## Using API Tokens

Once created, use your API token to authenticate API requests:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.qovery.com/organization
```

### With Qovery CLI

```bash
export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN
qovery context set
```

### With Terraform

```hcl
provider "qovery" {
  token = var.qovery_api_token
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Specific Roles">
    Assign the minimum required role to each token. Avoid using admin roles unless absolutely necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Tokens Regularly">
    Periodically create new tokens and delete old ones to maintain security.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store Tokens Securely">
    - Use secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
    - Never commit tokens to Git repositories
    - Use environment variables in CI/CD pipelines
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name tokens by their purpose (e.g., "GitHub Actions Deploy", "Terraform Production")
  </Accordion>
