description: "Manage Git tokens for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket"
---

## Overview

Git repository access allows Qovery to connect to your source code repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. By configuring Git tokens, you enable Qovery to:

- Clone your application source code
- Monitor repository changes for auto-deployment
- Access Dockerfiles and build contexts
- Read configuration files

Qovery supports multiple Git providers and allows you to manage multiple tokens per provider for different organizations or access levels.

## Supported Git Providers

Qovery integrates with the following Git providers:

- **GitHub** (GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise)
- **GitLab** (GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab)
- **Bitbucket** (Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Server)

## Delete a Git Token

To remove a Git token:

1. Locate the token in the Git Repository Access list
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) next to the token
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
If any applications are currently using repositories accessed through this token, they may fail to build or deploy. Ensure you have alternative access configured before deletion.
</Warning>

## Git Provider Specific Configurations

### GitHub Enterprise

For GitHub Enterprise installations:

1. Select GitHub as the provider
2. Enable "Custom URL" option
3. Enter your GitHub Enterprise URL (e.g., `https://github.company.com`)
4. Provide a token from your GitHub Enterprise instance

### Self-Hosted GitLab

For self-hosted GitLab installations:

1. Select GitLab as the provider
2. Enable "Custom URL" option
3. Enter your GitLab server URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.company.com`)
4. Provide a token from your GitLab instance
5. Ensure Qovery can reach your GitLab server (network accessibility)

### Bitbucket Server

For Bitbucket Server (Data Center):

1. Select Bitbucket as the provider
2. Enable "Custom URL" option
3. Enter your Bitbucket Server URL (e.g., `https://bitbucket.company.com`)
4. Provide an app password or personal access token
5. Ensure Qovery can reach your Bitbucket server

## Using Git Tokens

Once configured, Git tokens are automatically used when:

- Creating new applications from Git repositories
- Cloning repository code during builds
- Monitoring repository changes for auto-deployment
- Accessing Dockerfile and build context

### Selecting Repository During App Creation

When creating an application:

1. Choose "Git Repository" as the source
2. Select the Git provider from available tokens
3. Choose the repository from the dropdown
4. Select the branch to deploy

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Fine-Grained or Scoped Tokens">
    Instead of granting full access, use tokens with minimal required permissions:
    - GitHub: Use fine-grained tokens for specific repositories
    - GitLab: Use scoped tokens with only `read_repository` and `read_api`
    - Bitbucket: Grant only repository read permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Token Expiration">
    Always set an expiration date for tokens:
    - Recommended: 90 days to 1 year
    - Set calendar reminders before expiration
    - Plan for token rotation process
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Dedicated Service Accounts">
    Create dedicated Git accounts for Qovery integration:
    - Easier to manage and audit
    - Not tied to individual developer accounts
    - Reduces impact when team members leave
    - Better security and access control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Tokens for Different Purposes">
    Consider using separate tokens for:
    - Different Git organizations
    - Production vs development repositories
    - Different teams or projects
    - Public vs private repositories
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Token Rotation">
    Rotate Git tokens periodically for security:
    1. Create a new token with same permissions
    2. Update the token in Qovery
    3. Test with a deployment
    4. Revoke the old token in Git provider
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Token Usage">
    Regularly review token usage:
    - Check which repositories are accessed
    - Review audit logs in Git provider
    - Remove unused tokens
    - Monitor for suspicious activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name tokens clearly to indicate their purpose:
    - `github-main-org-production`
    - `gitlab-team-alpha`
    - `bitbucket-microservices`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Validation Failed">
    **Problem**: Token validation fails when adding or editing

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the token is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
    - Check token hasn't expired
    - Ensure token has required permissions:
      - GitHub: `repo` scope
      - GitLab: `read_repository` and `read_api` scopes
      - Bitbucket: Repository read permissions
    - For self-hosted: Verify the URL is correct and accessible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Access Repository">
    **Problem**: Qovery cannot access specific repositories

    **Solutions**:
    - For GitHub fine-grained tokens: Ensure repository is included in token access
    - For organization repositories: Ensure token has `read:org` permission
    - Verify repository isn't archived or deleted
    - Check repository visibility (private repositories need appropriate access)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build Fails to Clone Repository">
    **Problem**: Application builds fail during git clone step

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Git token is still valid
    - Check token permissions haven't been revoked
    - Ensure repository still exists and hasn't been renamed
    - For self-hosted Git: Verify network connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Deploy Not Working">
    **Problem**: Changes to repository don't trigger deployments

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify webhook permissions are included in token
    - GitHub: Add `workflow` scope if using GitHub Actions
    - Bitbucket: Ensure webhook permissions are granted
    - Check webhook configuration in repository settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Hosted Git Server Not Accessible">
    **Problem**: Cannot connect to self-hosted GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the URL format is correct (include https://)
    - Check firewall rules allow Qovery IP addresses
    - Ensure DNS resolution works for your Git server
    - Verify SSL certificates are valid
    - For private networks: Configure VPC peering or VPN
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token Storage">
    - Qovery encrypts Git tokens at rest
    - Tokens are never logged or exposed in build logs
    - Access to tokens is restricted to authorized Qovery services
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook Security">
    - Qovery validates webhook signatures from Git providers
    - Webhook endpoints use authentication tokens
    - All webhook traffic is over HTTPS
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audit and Compliance">
    - Review token access regularly in Git provider audit logs
    - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
    - Use Git provider's security features (2FA, IP allowlists)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
