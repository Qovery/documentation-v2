title: "Audit Logs"
description: "Monitor and track all actions within your organization"
---

<Info>
This feature is available in **public beta**. Access and functionalities might change in the future based on your Qovery Plan.
</Info>

Qovery allows you to monitor any action that happened within your organization thanks to the audit logs section. This section provides you with a complete view of any change that occurred within your organization configuration, answering "who did what, where, and when?"

This is extremely useful when:
- Debugging complex issues
- Understanding what happened in a specific timeframe
- Monitoring actions done by users within your organization
- Compliance and security auditing

## Accessing Audit Logs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Audit Logs">
    Click the **Audit logs** section from the left navigation bar in your Qovery console

    ![Audit Logs Access](/images/configuration/audit-logs/audit-logs-access.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Events">
    You'll see a list of events that occurred within your organization over the past **30 days** (maximum retention time)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
From a technical point of view, Qovery tracks in the audit logs any call happening on our API for your organization.

**Example**: If you modify the configuration of an application via the Qovery console, Qovery will track the call to the API endpoint `/application` and log an **UPDATE** event.
</Info>

## Event Information

Each event in the list contains the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When the event happened |
| **Event Type** | Type of event (Create, Update, Delete, Trigger Deployment, etc.) |
| **Target Type** | Type of object modified (Environment, Cluster, Role, Image registry, etc.) |
| **Target** | The specific object that was modified (hover for additional information) |
| **Change** | What was modified (high-level: configuration, deployment rule, etc.) |
| **User** | Who modified the object (if via API, shows the API token name) |
| **Tool** | How the object was changed (console, Terraform provider, git push, etc.) |

### Event Details

Click on any event to view the **JSON response** from the API call. This JSON represents the status of the target object **after** the event occurred.

**Example**: If an UPDATE happened on an application's configuration, the stored event will provide access to the JSON returned by the API when the `/application` endpoint was called. This JSON contains the application's configuration after the update.

<Tip>
To understand what changed between two events, click on both events and compare their JSON responses.
</Tip>

## Filtering Events

Filter events to simplify your search:

### Standard Filters

- **Time Range**: Select a specific date range
- **Target**: Specify:
  1. Target type (cluster, environment, service, etc.)
  2. Target name (e.g., select "Production" from the cluster list)

### Quick Filters

While navigating within the console, quick filters allow you to jump directly to audit logs for specific objects.

**Example**: Get events for a specific environment by clicking the **See Events** button in the 3-dot sub-menu of the environment.

## Export Audit Logs

Export your audit logs using the Qovery CLI for compliance, archiving, or external analysis.

### Export Command

```bash
qovery audit-log export \
  --from-date="2025-10-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --to-date="2025-10-10T00:00:00Z"
```

### Parameters

- `--from-date` **(required)**: Start date for the export
- `--to-date` **(optional)**: End date for the export (defaults to current date/time if not specified)

<Info>
**Date Format Requirements**:
- Dates must use ISO-8601 date-time format
- Dates are UTC-based by default
- You can use offset format: `2025-10-01T01:00:00+02:00`

**Examples**:
- UTC: `2025-10-01T00:00:00Z`
- With timezone offset: `2025-10-01T01:00:00+02:00`
- Current time: omit `--to-date`
</Info>

### Export Example

Export logs for the entire month of September 2025:

```bash
qovery audit-log export \
