## Overview

This section allows you to define the container registries available within your organization. Once configured, only images stored in these registered container registries will be allowed to be deployed on your clusters.

By connecting container registries to your organization, you can deploy applications using images from these registries across all your projects and environments.

<Info>
Container registries configured here apply to the entire organization and are available for all projects.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize by Environment">
    Consider creating separate registry connections for different environments (development, staging, production) for better security and access management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name registries clearly to indicate their purpose:
    - `aws-ecr-production-us-east-1`
    - `docker-hub-public-images`
    - `gcr-staging-europe`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Credential Rotation">
    Periodically rotate registry credentials for security:
    1. Create new credentials in your registry provider
    2. Update the registry configuration in Qovery
    3. Test with a deployment
    4. Remove old credentials from the provider
