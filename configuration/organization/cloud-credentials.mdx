## Overview

The Cloud Credentials Management interface provides a centralized location to view and manage all cloud provider credentials. These credentials are automatically listed when a cluster is provisioned.

This interface gives you visibility into all credentials, allows you to see which clusters are using them, and provides actions to update or delete them as needed.

![How to access your cloud credentials](/images/configuration/organization/cloud-credentials.png)

## Viewing Credentials and Their Usage

Each cloud credential is displayed with details such as:
- Credential name
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Scaleway)
- Public access key or ARN role
- Associated clusters

Next to each credential, you'll find a **View Associated Clusters** button. Clicking it opens a list of all clusters that are currently using the credential, helping you assess the impact before making changes.

## Editing a Credential

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Edit Button">
    Locate the credential you want to modify and click the **Edit** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Credential Properties">
    Modify key properties such as:
    - Access keys
    - Secret keys
    - Configuration settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Changes are saved and applied to the system immediately. Updated credentials will be used during the **next deployment** of each associated cluster.
</Info>

## Deleting a Credential

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Associated Clusters">
    Click **View Associated Clusters** to see which clusters use this credential
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Associations">
    If the credential is linked to clusters, remove the association from those clusters first
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete Credential">
    Once no clusters are associated, click the **Delete** button
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If a credential is still linked to one or more clusters, deletion won't be possible. You must first remove its association from those clusters.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Usage Before Changes">
    Always check associated clusters by clicking the **View Associated Clusters** button before editing or deleting credentials. This helps prevent disruptions during future deployments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Assign clear, descriptive names to credentials for easier identification. Examples:
    - `aws-prod-us-east-1`
    - `gcp-staging-europe`
    - `azure-dev-westus`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Credential Rotation">
    Periodically rotate cloud credentials for security:
    1. Create new credentials in your cloud provider
    2. Edit the credential in Qovery with new values
    3. Deploy clusters to apply new credentials
    4. Delete old credentials from your cloud provider
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean Up Unused Credentials">
    Regularly review and delete unused credentials to maintain a secure environment and reduce clutter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use IAM Roles When Possible">
    For AWS, prefer IAM roles over access keys for better security:
    - More secure (no long-lived credentials)
    - Easier to manage and rotate
    - Better audit trail in CloudTrail
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cloud Provider Requirements

### AWS

<Info>
**Source**: Content below is maintained in `/snippets/aws-credentials-*.mdx`. Update snippets first, then copy to all usage locations.
</Info>

AWS credentials can be configured using two methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="STS Assume Role (Recommended)">
    **Most secure method** - Uses temporary credentials that auto-rotate. No access keys to manage.

    **What gets created**: A CloudFormation stack creates an IAM role with this policy:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "ec2:*",
            "eks:*",
            "iam:*",
            "elasticloadbalancing:*",
            "autoscaling:*",
            "logs:*",
            "s3:*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **Setup Steps**:

    1. **In Qovery Console**: Click the **CloudFormation link** shown
       - This opens AWS CloudFormation in a new tab (you're logged in automatically)

    2. **In AWS CloudFormation Console**:
       - Click **Next** (template is pre-filled with Qovery's requirements)
       - Stack name: Keep default `qovery-iam-role` or customize
       - Click **Next** (skip stack options)
       - Click **Next** again (skip tags)
       - ✅ **Important**: Check **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**
       - Click **Create stack**

    3. **Wait for completion** (~1 minute):
       - Status changes: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` → `CREATE_COMPLETE`
       - Refresh page if needed

    4. **Get the Role ARN**:
       - Click on the **Outputs** tab
       - Find **RoleArn** key
       - Copy the value (looks like: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/qovery-role`)

       <Frame>
         <img src="/images/aws-credentials/stack-output.png" alt="CloudFormation stack output with Role ARN" />
       </Frame>

    5. **Complete in Qovery**:
       - Back in Qovery, paste the **Role ARN**
       - Give it a name like `AWS Production`
       - Click **Save**

       <Frame>
         <img src="/images/install-qovery/aws/create-credentials.jpg" alt="Enter Role ARN in Qovery Console" />
       </Frame>

    <Tip>
    **Why this is recommended**: The IAM role uses AWS STS (Security Token Service) to generate temporary credentials that automatically rotate. Qovery never has access to long-lived credentials, and you can revoke access instantly by deleting the CloudFormation stack.
    </Tip>

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="What permissions does Qovery need?">
        Qovery requires these AWS permissions to manage your infrastructure:
        - **EC2**: Create VPCs, subnets, security groups, and instances
        - **EKS**: Create and manage Kubernetes clusters
        - **IAM**: Create service roles for EKS and EC2
        - **ELB**: Create load balancers for your applications
        - **S3**: Store Terraform state and logs
        - **CloudWatch**: Collect logs and metrics

        You can review the full CloudFormation template before creating the stack.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Can I use a custom IAM policy?">
        Yes! For production environments, you can create a custom IAM policy with minimum required permissions. Contact support for the minimal policy template.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Static Credentials">
    **Alternative method** - Uses AWS Access Keys (requires manual rotation every 90 days).

    **What gets created**: An IAM user with AdministratorAccess policy and programmatic access keys.

    <Warning>
    **Security Note**: Static credentials don't expire and must be manually rotated. Only use this method if CloudFormation is not available in your AWS environment. For production, we strongly recommend STS Assume Role.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
    If you have multiple subscriptions, you can specify which one to use by passing it as a parameter to the script.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions does Qovery need?">
    Qovery requires these Azure permissions to manage your infrastructure:
    - **Contributor Role**: Full access to create and manage resources (AKS, VMs, VNets, Load Balancers, etc.)
    - **Resource Group Management**: Create and manage resource groups
    - **Azure Kubernetes Service**: Create and manage AKS clusters
    - **Virtual Network**: Configure VNets, subnets, NSGs, and NAT Gateways
    - **Compute**: Provision VM Scale Sets for node pools
    - **Storage**: Create and manage Managed Disks for persistent storage
    - **DNS**: Configure DNS zones and records

    The service principal created by the script is assigned the **Contributor** role at the subscription level, which provides all necessary permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a Service Principal?">
    A service principal is an identity created for use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. It's similar to a "service account" in other cloud providers.

    **Key benefits:**
    - **Security**: No need to share personal Azure credentials
    - **Scope Control**: Permissions limited to specific subscription
    - **Auditability**: All actions tracked in Azure Activity Log
    - **Revocable**: Can be deleted without affecting user accounts

    The service principal uses certificate-based authentication, which is more secure than password-based authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I rotate credentials?">
    To rotate Azure credentials:
    1. In Azure Portal, go to **Azure Active Directory** → **App registrations**
    2. Find the Qovery service principal (name starts with `qovery-`)
    3. Go to **Certificates & secrets**
    4. Add a new certificate or client secret
    5. Run the Qovery credential creation script again to generate new credentials
    6. Update credentials in Qovery Console
    7. Wait 24 hours to ensure all systems use new credentials
    8. Remove the old certificate/secret in Azure Portal

    <Info>
    Qovery uses certificate-based authentication by default, which is more secure than client secrets.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use an existing service principal?">
    Yes! If you have an existing service principal with the Contributor role, you can use it instead of creating a new one. However, ensure it has:
    - Contributor role at the subscription level (or at minimum, the resource group where clusters will be created)
    - Certificate or client secret configured
    - No expiration date conflicts with your security policies

    You'll need to manually provide the credentials to Qovery Console instead of using the automated script.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the script fails?">
    **Common issues and solutions:**

    **"Insufficient privileges"**:
    - You need at least "User Access Administrator" or "Owner" role to create service principals
    - Contact your Azure administrator for assistance

    **"PowerShell mode detected"**:
    - The script only runs in Bash mode
    - Click the dropdown in Cloud Shell and select "Bash"

    **"Subscription not found"**:
    - Verify the Subscription ID is correct
    - Ensure the subscription is active and not disabled
    - Check you have access to the subscription

    **"Tenant ID mismatch"**:
    - Verify you're logged into the correct Azure tenant
    - Some accounts have access to multiple tenants - switch if needed

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    1. Click on your newly created application
    2. Go to **API keys** tab
    3. Click **+ Generate API key**
    4. Description: "Qovery cluster access"
    5. Select **Object Storage preferred Project** (your main project)
    6. Click **Generate API key**

    <Warning>
    **Save these credentials immediately!** The secret key is only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.
    </Warning>

    You'll see:
    - **Access key ID**: `SCWxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
    - **Secret access key**: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

    Copy both to a secure location.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    1. Go to **Policies** tab in IAM
    2. Click **+ Create policy**
    3. Name it: `qovery-permissions`
    4. Click **Add rule** for each of these permission sets:

    **Required Permissions:**
    - ✅ **Containers** - Full access (for Kapsule management)
    - ✅ **Network Services** - Full access (for VPC, Load Balancers)
    - ✅ **Compute** - Full access (for instances)
    - ✅ **Storage** - Full access (for persistent volumes)
    - ✅ **VPC** - Full access (for networking)

    5. Under **Principal**, attach this policy to your application
    6. Click **Create policy**

    <Info>
    These permissions allow Qovery to fully manage your Kubernetes infrastructure, including creating instances, configuring networking, and managing storage.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Gather Required IDs">
    You'll need these identifiers:

    **Organization ID:**
    1. Go to **Organization Settings**
    2. Copy the **Organization ID** (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

    **Project ID:**
    1. Go to your **Project Dashboard**
    2. Click **Project settings**
    3. Copy the **Project ID** (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

    <Tip>
    Keep these IDs handy - you'll need them when configuring Qovery.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Cluster Creation">
    1. Go to [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
    2. Click **Clusters** in the left sidebar
    3. Click **Create Cluster**
    4. Select **Scaleway** as the cloud provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Provide the information you gathered:
    - **Access Key ID**: Your Scaleway access key
    - **Secret Access Key**: Your Scaleway secret key
    - **Organization ID**: Your Scaleway organization ID
    - **Project ID**: Your Scaleway project ID

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/scaleway-credentials/create-credentials.jpg" alt="Enter Scaleway credentials in Qovery Console" />
    </Frame>

    Click **Next** to validate the credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Qovery will test the credentials and verify it can access your Scaleway account.

    <Info>
    If validation fails, double-check your API key has all required permissions attached via the policy.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What permissions does Qovery need?">
    Qovery requires these Scaleway permissions to manage your infrastructure:
    - **Containers**: Create and manage Kapsule Kubernetes clusters
    - **Network Services**: Configure Load Balancers, DNS, and Public Gateways
    - **Compute**: Provision and manage instances for node pools
    - **Storage**: Create and manage Block Storage volumes for persistent data
    - **VPC**: Configure Private Networks, Security Groups, and network routing

    These permissions are applied via IAM policies attached to your API key's application.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use a custom IAM policy?">
    Yes! You can create a custom IAM policy with more restrictive permissions. However, ensure it includes all the resource types needed for managing Kapsule, networking, compute, and storage. Missing permissions may cause deployment failures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I rotate credentials?">
    To rotate Scaleway credentials:
    1. In Scaleway Console, go to **IAM** → **Applications**
    2. Find your application (e.g., `qovery-manager`)
    3. Go to **API keys** tab
    4. Click **+ Generate API key** to create a new key
    5. Update credentials in Qovery Console
    6. Wait 24 hours to ensure all systems use new keys
    7. Delete the old API key in Scaleway Console
    8. Set a reminder to rotate again in 90 days
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the credential formats?">
    - **Access Key ID**: Starts with `SCW` followed by alphanumeric characters
    - **Secret Access Key**: UUID format (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
    - **Organization ID**: UUID format
    - **Project ID**: UUID format

    All UUIDs use the standard 8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal format.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Credential Validation Failed">
    **Problem**: Credential validation fails when editing

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the access keys are correct
    - Check that the credentials have not expired
    - Ensure proper IAM permissions are configured
    - For AWS IAM roles, verify the trust relationship is correct
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Delete Credential">
    **Problem**: Delete button is disabled or deletion fails

    **Solution**: The credential is still associated with one or more clusters. Use the **View Associated Clusters** button to identify which clusters are using it, then remove the association.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cluster Deployment Fails After Update">
    **Problem**: Cluster deployment fails after updating credentials

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the new credentials have the required permissions
    - Check cloud provider console for any access issues
    - Review Qovery deployment logs for specific error messages
    - Revert to previous credentials if needed
