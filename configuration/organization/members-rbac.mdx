    Click the **Remove** button (trash icon) next to the member
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>

</Warning>

1. Locate the pending invitation in the Members list
2. Click the **Resend** button
3. A new invitation email will be sent

### Revoking Invitations

## API Tokens and RBAC

API tokens can be assigned roles just like human users. When creating an API token:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** > **API Tokens**
2. Create a new token and assign a role
3. The token will have the same permissions as a user with that role

<Note>
For security, use the minimal role required for your API token. For example, use DevOps role for CI/CD deployments, not Owner or Admin.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Follow Principle of Least Privilege">
    Grant users the minimum access they need:
    - Start with Viewer role by default
    - Elevate to DevOps for operational access
    - Reserve Admin for platform team leads
    - Limit Owner role to 2-3 people maximum
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews">
    Periodically review member access:
    - Quarterly access audits
    - Remove inactive members
    - Verify role assignments are still appropriate
    - Check for over-privileged accounts
    - Review API token permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Multiple Owners">
    Always have at least 2-3 Owners:
    - Prevents lockout if an Owner leaves
    - Ensures business continuity
    - Allows for vacation/leave coverage
    - Choose Owners from different teams
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate Billing Access">
    Use Billing Manager role for finance team:
    - No access to infrastructure
    - Can manage billing independently
    - Reduces security surface area

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audit with Viewer Role">
    Use Viewer role for:
    - Security team access

  <Accordion title="Use SSO When Available">
    If using enterprise SSO:
    - Centralize identity management

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot Invite Member">
    **Problem**: Invitation fails or button is disabled

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify you have Admin or Owner role
    - Check if member is already invited
    - Verify email address is valid
    - Check organization member limit
    - Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Member Cannot Accept Invitation">
    **Problem**: Invited member cannot access the organization

    **Solutions**:
    - Check spam folder for invitation email
    - Resend invitation from Members page
    - Verify email address is correct
    - Ensure invitation hasn't expired (7 days)
    - Member should use the exact email invited
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
    **Problem**: User sees permission denied for certain actions

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify user's current role in Members page
    - Check permissions matrix above
    - Request role upgrade from Admin/Owner
    - Use API token with appropriate role if automating
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Remove Last Owner">
    **Problem**: Cannot remove the last Owner from organization

    **Solution**: Qovery requires at least one Owner. Promote another member to Owner before removing the current one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role Change Not Taking Effect">
    **Problem**: Permission changes not working after role update

    **Solutions**:
    - Ask user to log out and log back in
    - Clear browser cache
    - Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
    - Verify role was saved correctly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Offboarding Checklist">
    When a team member leaves:
    1. Remove member from organization immediately

    3. Rotate shared credentials they had access to
    4. Review audit logs for their activities
    5. Update documentation they maintained
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Audit Log Reviews">
    Monitor audit logs for:
    - Unusual access patterns

</AccordionGroup>
