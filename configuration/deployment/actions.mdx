## Deploy

The **Deploy** action creates or updates the resources needed to run your application on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploy Process

When you trigger a deploy action, the following sequence occurs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="QUEUED">
    Deployment request is added to the queue
  </Step>
  <Step title="BUILDING">
    Code is built and containerized (for Git-based deployments)
  </Step>
  <Step title="DEPLOYING">
    Container is deployed to Kubernetes with proper configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="DEPLOYMENT OK">
    Service is running and healthy on the cluster
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Use Deploy

- Deploying a new application for the first time
- Deploying code changes after a Git commit
- Deploying a new container image version
- Applying configuration changes that require redeployment

### Deploy Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console">
    Deploy from the Qovery web console:

    1. Navigate to your service
    2. Click the "Deploy" button
    3. Confirm the deployment
    4. Monitor progress in real-time
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CLI">
    Deploy using the Qovery CLI:

    ```bash
    # Deploy application
    qovery application deploy

    # Deploy specific service
    qovery application deploy --application <app-name>

    # Deploy with watch mode
    qovery application deploy --watch
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">
    Deploy via the Qovery API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      "https://api.qovery.com/application/$APPLICATION_ID/deploy" \
      -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Redeploy

The **Redeploy** action updates the remote configuration of your services without building new container images.

### What Redeploy Does

Redeploy uses a **rolling-restart** deployment logic:
- Updates Kubernetes configuration (environment variables, resources, etc.)
- Gradually replaces pods with new configuration
- Maintains service availability during the update
- No new container image is built

### When to Use Redeploy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="key">
    Update environment variables without rebuilding
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Limits" icon="server">
    Adjust CPU or memory limits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scaling" icon="chart-line">
    Change replica count or autoscaling settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration" icon="gear">
    Update service configuration like ports or domains
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Redeploy Example

```bash
# Update environment variable
qovery env set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://new-host:5432/db"

# Redeploy to apply changes
qovery application redeploy
```

## Stop

The **Stop** action stops your service from running on the cluster while preserving all attached storage.

### What Happens When You Stop

- All running pods are terminated
- Kubernetes resources are deleted
- Persistent volumes and storage are preserved
- Service no longer consumes compute resources

### When to Use Stop

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Optimization" icon="dollar-sign">
    Stop non-production environments outside business hours
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maintenance" icon="wrench">
    Temporarily stop services during maintenance windows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Testing" icon="flask">
    Stop ephemeral test environments after testing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Management" icon="server">
    Free up cluster resources for other workloads
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Stopping a service makes it unavailable. Users will not be able to access stopped services.
</Warning>

### Stop Example

```bash
# Stop a single application
qovery application stop

# Stop entire environment
qovery environment stop
```

## Restart Service

The **Restart** action restarts your service pods without making any configuration changes.

### What Restart Does

- Terminates existing pods
- Creates new pods with the same configuration
- No new build process
- Same container image is used

### When to Use Restart

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clear State" icon="broom">
    Clear in-memory state or caches
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recover from Errors" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Recover from transient errors or deadlocks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apply Hot Fixes" icon="fire">
    Restart after applying hot fixes manually
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Resilience" icon="shield">
    Test application resilience and startup behavior
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Restart Example

```bash
# Restart application
qovery application restart
```

## Cancel Deployment

The **Cancel** action aborts an ongoing deployment and rolls back to the previous version.

### Cancel Behavior

When you cancel a deployment:
1. The current deployment process is interrupted
2. Kubernetes resources are rolled back to the previous state
3. The service returns to its last known good version
4. Deployment status changes to "CANCELLED"

### When to Use Cancel

- Deployment is taking too long
- You realize the wrong version is being deployed
- Build or deployment errors are detected
- Need to quickly rollback to previous version

<Warning>
Canceling a deployment during the BUILDING phase may leave partial artifacts in your container registry.
</Warning>

### Cancel Example

```bash
# Cancel ongoing deployment
qovery application cancel
```

## Deploy Other Version

The **Deploy Other Version** action allows you to deploy a specific Git commit or container image tag.

![Deploy Other Version](/images/deployment/deploy_other_version.png)

### Deploy Specific Git Commit

For Git-based applications, deploy any commit from your repository:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Application">
    Navigate to your application in the console
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Deploy Other Version'">
    Click the deployment actions menu and select "Deploy Other Version"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Commit">
    Select the specific commit hash you want to deploy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deployment">
    Review and confirm the deployment
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deploy Specific Container Tag

For container-based applications, deploy any image tag:

```bash
# Deploy specific tag via CLI
qovery application deploy --tag v2.1.0

# Deploy specific commit via CLI
qovery application deploy --commit abc123def
```

### Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rollback" icon="rotate-left">
    Deploy a previous stable version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hot Fix" icon="fire">
    Deploy a specific hot fix commit
  </Card>
  <Card title="Testing" icon="flask">
    Test a specific version in staging
  </Card>
  <Card title="Release Management" icon="tags">
    Deploy tagged releases to production
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Deploy Latest Version

The **Deploy Latest Version** action deploys the most recent version for selected services in your environment.

![Deploy Latest Version](/images/deployment/deploy_latest_version.png)

### What It Does

- Fetches the latest commit from the configured branch
- Deploys all selected services with their latest versions
- Useful when multiple services need updating simultaneously

### When to Use

- Update all services after a sync period
- Deploy latest changes across microservices
- Refresh development environments with latest code

### Deploy Latest Example

```bash
# Deploy latest version for all services
qovery environment deploy --latest

# Deploy latest for specific services
qovery application deploy --latest --application api,worker
```

## Deployment Action Queueing

Qovery implements intelligent deployment queueing to manage concurrent deployment requests.

### How Queueing Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Single Action at a Time">
    Only one deployment action is processed per service at any given time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Queuing">
    Subsequent deployment requests are automatically queued
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Merging">
    Similar requests from the same user can be merged to avoid redundant deployments
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sequential Processing">
    Queued requests are processed in order once the current action completes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Request Merging Rules

Deployment requests are merged when:
- Same user triggers multiple deploy actions
- Same action type (e.g., multiple deploy requests)
- Target is the same service or environment
- Previous request hasn't started executing

<Info>
Request merging prevents deployment queue buildup and ensures only the latest desired state is deployed.
</Info>

## Deployment Status Tracking

Monitor deployment action progress through various statuses:

| Status | Description | Next Steps |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| QUEUED | Deployment is waiting in queue | Wait for execution to begin |
| BUILDING | Code is being built into container image | Monitor build logs |
| DEPLOYING | Container is being deployed to Kubernetes | Check deployment logs |
| DEPLOYMENT OK | Service is running successfully | Monitor service health |
| BUILDING ERROR | Build process failed | Check build logs for errors |
| DEPLOYMENT ERROR | Deployment to Kubernetes failed | Check deployment logs |
| CANCELLED | Deployment was cancelled | Review cancellation reason |

See [Deployment Statuses](/configuration/deployment/statuses) for complete details.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deployment stuck in QUEUED state">
    If your deployment is stuck in the queue:
    1. Check if another deployment is currently running
    2. Cancel any stuck deployments blocking the queue
    3. Verify cluster has available resources
    4. Check Qovery status page for platform issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deploy action fails immediately">
    If deployment fails right away:
    1. Review deployment logs for error messages
    2. Check application configuration for errors
    3. Verify container registry credentials are valid
    4. Ensure Dockerfile is valid (for Git deployments)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot stop a running service">
    If you can't stop a service:
    1. Wait for any ongoing deployments to complete
    2. Check for deployment locks or restrictions
    3. Verify you have appropriate permissions
    4. Try stopping from CLI or API instead of console
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redeploy doesn't update configuration">
    If redeploy isn't applying changes:
    1. Verify changes were saved in settings
    2. Check for environment variable syntax errors
    3. Review deployment logs for warning messages
    4. Try a full deploy instead of redeploy
