The deployment history feature allows you to view and track all past deployments for your environments and services. This provides visibility into what was deployed, when, and by whom.

## Accessing Deployment History

You can access the deployment history from the **Deployments** tab on any environment or service page.

## Use Cases

### Troubleshooting Failed Deployments

When a deployment fails, use the history to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Failed Deployment">
    Locate the failed deployment in the history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Logs">
    Click to view detailed error logs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare with Success">
    Compare with the last successful deployment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Root Cause">
    Determine what changed that caused the failure
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Auditing and Compliance

Use deployment history for audit trails:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Change Tracking" icon="list-check">
    Track all changes made to production environments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compliance Reports" icon="file-contract">
    Generate reports showing deployment activity

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Performance Analysis

Analyze deployment performance over time:

<Accordion title="Deployment Metrics">
  Track important deployment metrics:
  - **Average deployment time**: How long deployments typically take
  - **Success rate**: Percentage of successful deployments
  - **Failure patterns**: Common failure reasons or timing
  - **Deployment frequency**: How often services are deployed
  - **Peak deployment times**: When most deployments occur
</Accordion>

## Rollback Using History

One of the most powerful features of deployment history is the ability to rollback to previous versions:

### How to Rollback

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Stable Version">
    Locate the last known good deployment in the history
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Deployment">
    Click on the deployment you want to rollback to
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Rollback">
    Select "Rollback to this version" from the actions menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Rollback">
    Review the changes and confirm the rollback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Watch the rollback deployment complete
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Rollback creates a new deployment using the previous version's configuration. It does not reverse database migrations or data changes.
</Warning>

### Rollback Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Document Reason" icon="note">
    Always document why you're rolling back
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notify Team" icon="users">
    Inform your team before rolling back production
  </Card>
  <Card title="Check Dependencies" icon="sitemap">
    Ensure dependent services are compatible
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor After Rollback" icon="chart-line">
    Watch metrics closely after rollback completes
  </Card>

### Exporting History

Export deployment history for long-term archival:

```bash
# Export deployment history via CLI
qovery deployment history --export csv

# Export for specific environment
qovery deployment history --environment production --export json

# Export for date range
qovery deployment history --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-12-31 --export csv
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### Monitoring and Alerting

Link deployment history with monitoring:
- **Correlate Metrics**: Match performance changes with deployments
- **Alert on Failures**: Notify team when deployments fail
- **Track Rollbacks**: Monitor rollback frequency

### CI/CD Integration

Connect deployment history with your CI/CD:
- **Deployment Webhooks**: Send notifications on deployment events
- **Status Checks**: Query deployment status from pipelines
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Trigger rollbacks based on health checks

## API Access

Access deployment history programmatically via the Qovery API:

```bash
# Get deployment history for an environment
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/$ENVIRONMENT_ID/deployments" \

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long is deployment history retained?">
    Deployment history is retained based on your Qovery plan, ranging from 30 days (Free) to 1 year (Business) or custom retention for Enterprise customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete deployment history?">
    Individual deployment history entries cannot be deleted as they serve as an audit trail. However, entries older than your plan's retention period are automatically archived.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does rollback affect database data?">
    No, rollback only reverts application code and configuration. Database migrations and data changes are not automatically reversed. You must handle database rollbacks separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I compare two deployments?">
    Yes, you can select two deployments from the history and compare their configurations, code changes, and service differences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are auto-deployments shown in history?">
    Yes, all deployments are shown in the history regardless of how they were triggered (manual, auto-deploy, CI/CD, or scheduled).
