    3. View logs only from that instance

    **Use Case:** Debugging issues affecting only certain replicas
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="All Pods">
    View aggregated logs from all pods:

    - Shows logs from all replicas
    - Useful for overall application behavior
    - Can identify patterns across instances

    **Use Case:** Monitoring general application health
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multiple Pods">
    Select multiple specific pods:

    - Compare behavior across selected pods
    - Identify pod-specific issues
    - Useful for canary deployments

    **Use Case:** Comparing old vs new version pods
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting with Logs

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Application not starting">
    **Check:**
    1. Build logs for compilation errors
    2. Deployment logs for image pull issues
    3. Application logs for startup errors
    4. Health check logs for failures

    **Common Patterns:**
    - `Error: Cannot connect to database` - Check database connectivity
    - `Port already in use` - Check port configuration
    - `Permission denied` - Check file permissions or user context
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Intermittent errors">
    **Investigation Steps:**
    1. Filter logs by error level
    2. Identify which pods are generating errors
    3. Check timing patterns (time of day, load correlation)
    4. Compare healthy vs unhealthy pod logs

    **Common Patterns:**
    - `Connection timeout` - Network or dependency issues
    - `Out of memory` - Resource constraints
    - `Database connection pool exhausted` - Need more connections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance issues">
    **What to Look For:**
    1. Slow request logs (response times)
    2. Database query performance
    3. External API call durations
    4. Memory usage patterns

    **Common Patterns:**
    - `Slow query: SELECT * FROM...` - Database optimization needed
    - `GC pause: 5000ms` - Heap size issues
    - `Request timeout after 30s` - Increase timeouts or optimize
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment failures">
    **Check These Logs:**
    1. Build logs for build failures
    2. Deployment logs for Kubernetes errors
    3. Pod events for scheduling issues
    4. Previous successful deployment logs for comparison

    **Common Patterns:**
    - `ImagePullBackOff` - Image doesn't exist or auth issues
    - `CrashLoopBackOff` - Application failing to start
    - `Insufficient CPU/Memory` - Need more resources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Log Forwarding
