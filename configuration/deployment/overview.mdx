Qovery is a DevOps Automation Platform helping 200+ organizations to ship faster and eliminate DevOps hiring needs. This guide explains how the deployment process works on Qovery.

## How Deployment Works

When you push code to your Git repository, Qovery can automatically deploy your applications through several trigger mechanisms:

### Deployment Triggers

Qovery supports three main ways to trigger deployments:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Auto-Deploy" icon="rotate">
    Automatically deploy when commits are pushed to your Git repository
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD Integration" icon="code-branch">
    Integrate with your existing CI/CD pipeline for custom workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Deployment" icon="hand">
    Deploy manually from the Qovery console when you're ready
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Deployment Pipeline Steps

When a deployment is triggered, Qovery executes the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration Processing">
    The Qovery engine processes your application configuration and environment settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Code Retrieval">
    Qovery pulls the latest code from your Git repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build & Registry">
    Your code is built into a container image and pushed to a container registry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Configuration">
    Load balancers and network configuration are created for your services
  </Step>
  <Step title="Kubernetes Deployment">
    Your application is deployed to a dedicated Kubernetes namespace
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain & TLS Setup">
    Custom domains and TLS certificates are automatically configured
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Kubernetes Orchestration

All deployments run on Kubernetes, which serves as the universal orchestrator for your applications:

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway
- **Namespace Isolation**: Each environment gets its own Kubernetes namespace
- **Automated Scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms

## Monitoring Your Deployments

Qovery provides comprehensive tools to monitor and manage your deployments:
