---

The auto-deploy feature allows you to automatically update your applications on Qovery whenever new commits are pushed to your Git repository. This enables continuous deployment without manual intervention.

## How Auto-Deploy Works

Each time a commit is pushed to your Git repository, Qovery receives a webhook call containing information about the commit. Qovery then determines which applications should be automatically re-deployed based on your configuration.

## Enabling Auto-Deploy

You can enable auto-deploy in two ways:

### During Service Creation

Enable auto-deploy when creating a new application:

<img src="/images/deployment/auto-deploy-creation-flow.png" alt="Auto-Deploy Creation Flow" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Application">
    Start the application creation flow from your environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Git Repository">
    Select your Git provider and repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Auto-Deploy">
    Toggle the auto-deploy option during the setup process
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Branch">
    Select the branch that should trigger automatic deployments
  </Step>
</Steps>

### In Application Settings

Enable auto-deploy for existing applications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Application Settings">
    Navigate to your application and click on Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Auto-Deploy Section">
    Locate the "Auto-Deploy" configuration section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Auto-Deploy">
    Enable the auto-deploy feature for the selected branch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Save your settings to activate auto-deploy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Commit Filtering

You can configure commit filtering to avoid unnecessary deployments. This is useful when certain file changes shouldn't trigger a deployment.

### Filter Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="EXCLUDE Mode">
    **Exclude Mode** - Specify files or folders to ignore. Deployments will be triggered for all commits EXCEPT those that only modify the specified paths.

    **Example Use Cases:**
    - Exclude documentation updates: `docs/**`, `README.md`
    - Exclude CI configuration: `.github/**`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - Exclude non-code files: `*.md`, `*.txt`

    ```bash
    # Example exclusion patterns
    docs/**
    README.md
    *.md
    .github/**
    tests/**
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MATCH Mode">
    **Match Mode** - Specify files or folders that MUST be changed for a deployment to occur. Deployments will ONLY be triggered for commits that modify these paths.

    **Example Use Cases:**
    - Only deploy on source code changes: `src/**`
    - Only deploy on API changes: `api/**`, `services/**`
    - Only deploy on specific app: `apps/backend/**`

    ```bash
    # Example match patterns
    src/**
    api/**
    lib/**
    package.json
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pattern Syntax

Use glob patterns to define your commit filters:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `*` | Matches any characters except `/` | `*.md` matches all Markdown files |
| `**` | Matches any characters including `/` | `docs/**` matches all files in docs folder |
| `?` | Matches a single character | `test?.js` matches `test1.js`, `test2.js` |
| `[...]` | Matches a range of characters | `[a-z]*.js` matches files starting with lowercase letters |

## Container Image Auto-Deploy

For applications deployed from container registries (not Git), auto-deploy requires additional configuration:

<Warning>
Container registry auto-deploy requires manual notification to Qovery when a new image version is available. Qovery does not automatically check the container registry for new images.
</Warning>

### Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Container Registry">
    Set up your application to deploy from a container registry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Auto-Deploy">
    Enable auto-deploy in application settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate with CI/CD">
    Configure your CI/CD pipeline to notify Qovery after pushing new images
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Qovery API or CLI">
    Trigger deployments using the Qovery API or CLI when new images are available
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mono-Repository Support

Auto-deploy works seamlessly with mono-repositories where multiple applications share the same Git repository.

<Accordion title="How Mono-Repository Auto-Deploy Works">
  When you have multiple applications connected to the same repository:

  1. Each application can have its own commit filter configuration
  2. Qovery evaluates each commit against all configured applications
  3. Only applications whose filters match the commit are deployed
  4. This allows selective deployment based on changed files

  **Example Setup:**
  - **Frontend App**: Match pattern `apps/frontend/**`
  - **Backend App**: Match pattern `apps/backend/**`
  - **Shared Library**: Match pattern `libs/**` (triggers both apps)
</Accordion>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will stopped services auto-deploy?">
    No, auto-deploy will not restart stopped services. If your application is in a stopped state, auto-deploy will not trigger a deployment. You must manually start the application first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I temporarily disable auto-deploy?">
    Yes, you can disable auto-deploy at any time from your application settings without removing the configuration. This is useful when you want to pause automatic deployments temporarily.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if multiple commits are pushed quickly?">
    Qovery queues deployment requests. If multiple commits are pushed in quick succession, Qovery will optimize by deploying only the latest commit rather than deploying each commit individually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does auto-deploy work with protected branches?">
    Yes, auto-deploy works with protected branches. However, ensure your Qovery webhook has the necessary permissions to receive notifications for these branches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use auto-deploy with pull requests?">
    Auto-deploy is configured per branch. If you want to auto-deploy from pull request branches, you can configure your application to track those branches. However, this is typically used with preview environments rather than production.
