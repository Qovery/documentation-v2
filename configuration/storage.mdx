## Volume Types

### Persistent Volumes

Durable storage that persists across deployments:

```hcl
storage = [
  {
    type        = "PERSISTENT"
    size        = 10  # GB
    mount_point = "/data"
  }
]
```

### Temporary Storage

Ephemeral storage (deleted on pod restart):

```hcl
storage = [
  {
    type        = "EPHEMERAL"
    size        = 5  # GB
    mount_point = "/tmp"
  }
]
```

## Use Cases

- Database storage
- File uploads
- Cache directories
- Logs

## Backup & Restore

- Snapshot support
- Cross-region replication (enterprise)
- Point-in-time recovery
