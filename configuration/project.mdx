## Overview

A project is a logical grouping of environments that run the same application across different stages (development, staging, production, etc.). Projects help organize your infrastructure and manage access control for your team.

When you create a new organization, Qovery automatically creates a default project for you. You can customize project access using Qovery's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system.

## Prerequisites

- An existing organization in Qovery

## Creating a New Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Organization Settings">
    Navigate to your organization settings by clicking the "Wheel" button (⚙️) on the left navigation bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Project">
    Click the "NEW" button in the projects section

    ![Project Creation](/images/configuration/project/project_creation.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Project">
    Provide the following information:
    - **Project Name**: A descriptive name for your project
    - **Description**: (Optional) Brief description of the project's purpose
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Create" to finalize the project creation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

A typical project contains multiple environments for the same application:

```
Project: My Application
├── Development Environment
├── Staging Environment
└── Production Environment
```

Each environment can contain:
- Applications
- Databases
- Cronjobs
- Lifecycle jobs
- Helm charts

## Deleting a Project

<Warning>
Deleting a project is a **non-recoverable operation**. All associated data will be permanently deleted, including:
- All environments within the project
- All applications and services
- All databases and their data
- All configuration and secrets
- All deployment history
</Warning>

It is strongly recommended to:
1. **Backup important data** before deletion
2. **Stop all running services** to avoid unexpected charges
3. **Review all environments** to ensure nothing critical will be lost

To delete a project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Project Settings">
    Open the project settings page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Project">
    Choose the project you want to delete
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Danger Zone">
    Go to the "DANGER" section at the bottom of the settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete Project">
    Click the "Delete Project" button

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Type the project name to confirm the deletion
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize by Application">
    Create one project per application or service. This makes it easier to manage permissions and track costs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Clear Naming">
    Use descriptive names that indicate the application or service the project contains (e.g., "Frontend App", "API Service", "Data Pipeline").
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Standardize Environments">
    Maintain consistent environment naming across projects (e.g., dev, staging, production) for easier management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage RBAC">
    Use project-level access control to restrict who can deploy to production environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Project-Level Variables">
    Define common configuration at the project level to avoid duplication across environments.
  </Accordion>
