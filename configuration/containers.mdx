## Overview

Containers allow you to deploy any Docker image from public or private registries.

## Configuration

```hcl
resource "qovery_container" "redis" {
  environment_id = qovery_environment.prod.id
  name           = "cache"
  image_name     = "redis"
  tag            = "7-alpine"
  
  cpu    = 250
  memory = 512
  
  ports = [
    {
      internal_port = 6379
      protocol      = "TCP"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- Third-party services (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Custom internal tools
- Sidecar containers
