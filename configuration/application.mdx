description: "Configure and deploy applications on Qovery"

## Prerequisites

Before creating an application:

- You have created an [Environment](/configuration/environment)

## Overview

An application is a container unit that is part of a Project within an Environment. You can deploy multiple applications within the same environment, and they can communicate with each other and connect to databases.

## Deployment Sources

Qovery supports two deployment sources for applications:

### Git Repository

Qovery pulls your code from a Git repository, builds the application, and deploys it to your Kubernetes cluster.

**Supported Providers**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

### Container Registry

Qovery pulls a pre-built container image from your configured registry and deploys it to your Kubernetes cluster.

<Note>
Container registries must be configured at the organization level by administrators. See [Container Registry Management](/configuration/organization/container-registry).
</Note>

## Creating an Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Source">
    Choose **Git Repository** or **Container Registry** as your deployment source
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Source">
    **For Git Repository**:
    - Select Git provider
    - Choose repository
    - Select branch
    - Specify root application path (if not at repository root)
    - Configure Dockerfile path

    **For Container Registry**:
    - Select configured registry
    - Enter image name
    - Specify image tag
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Resources">
    - **vCPU**: Default 500m (0.5 cores)
    - **RAM**: Default 512MB
    - **GPU**: Optional GPU allocation (requires GPU-enabled cluster)
    - **Auto-scaling**: Configure min/max instances (optional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Ports">
    - **Internal Port**: Port your application listens on
    - **Protocol**: HTTPS, gRPC, TCP, or UDP
    - **Publicly Accessible**: Enable to expose via load balancer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Health Checks (Optional)">
    - **Liveness Probe**: Determines if container should be restarted
    - **Readiness Probe**: Determines if container should receive traffic
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Variables">
    Configure environment variables for your application
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Deploy">
    Review configuration and choose:
    - **Create**: Save configuration without deploying
    - **Create and Deploy**: Save and immediately deploy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### General Settings

**Git Repository Configuration**:
- Git provider and repository
- Branch selection
- Root application path
- Dockerfile path
- Build arguments
- Multi-stage build target selection

**Container Registry Configuration**:
- Registry selection
- Image name
- Image tag
- Entrypoint override
- CMD arguments override

### Resources

**CPU and Memory**:
- vCPU allocation (millicores)
- RAM allocation (MB/GB)
- Configure based on application needs

**GPU** (requires AWS with Karpenter):
- Number of GPUs per instance
- Available for AI/ML workloads

**Auto-scaling**:
- Minimum instances (default: 1)
- Maximum instances (default: 3)
- CPU threshold for scaling (default: 60%)
- Scale up: Triggered after 15 seconds above threshold
- Scale down: Triggered after 5 minutes below threshold

<Info>
Auto-scaling uses Kubernetes [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) to monitor resource usage.
</Info>

### Storage

**Ephemeral Storage** (default):
- Container filesystem
- Data lost on restart
- Use for temporary files and caches

**Persistent Storage**:
- Block storage volumes
- Data persists across restarts
- Configure mount path and size
- SSD storage type (fast_ssd)
- Typical range: 5GB-10GB

<Warning>
Persistent storage cannot be shared between replicas. For shared storage, use external services like S3 or blob storage.
</Warning>

### Ports

Configure network exposure for your application:

**Port Configuration**:
- **Internal Port**: Port your application listens on
- **External Port**: HTTPS defaults to 443, HTTP to 80
- **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC, TCP, UDP
- **Publicly Accessible**: Toggle to expose via load balancer
- **URL Rewriting**: Configure path rewriting (optional)

<Note>
For HTTP and gRPC protocols, the external port is set to 443 by default with automatic TLS.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Connection Timeouts**: Connections on public ports are automatically closed after 60 seconds by default. Configure custom timeouts in advanced settings for long-lived connections.
</Warning>

<Info>
**TCP/UDP Ports**: Exposing TCP/UDP ports publicly requires provisioning a dedicated load balancer, which takes approximately 15 minutes and incurs additional cloud provider costs.
</Info>

### Health Checks

**Liveness Probe**:
- Determines if container should be restarted
- Configure endpoint, port, initial delay, and intervals

**Readiness Probe**:
- Determines if container should receive traffic
- Configure endpoint, port, initial delay, and intervals

### Deployment Restrictions

Configure when deployments should be triggered:

- **File path filters**: Deploy only when specific files change
- **Branch filters**: Deploy only from specific branches

## Internet Connectivity

### Qovery-Assigned Domains

Every publicly accessible application receives an automatic domain with TLS certificate:

```
<app-name>-<random-id>.<cluster-id>.qovery.io
```

### Custom Domains

Add your own custom domain to your application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domain">
    Navigate to application settings → Domains → Add Domain
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Create a CNAME record in your DNS provider:
    ```
    CNAME: your-domain.com → <app-name>.<cluster-id>.qovery.io
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Qovery automatically validates DNS configuration and provisions SSL/TLS certificate
  </Step>
</Steps>

### CDN Proxy Mode

Enable CDN proxy mode for custom domains to route traffic through your CDN provider.

## Additional Features

### Service Connections

Applications can connect to:
- Databases within the same environment
- Other applications within the same environment
- External services via environment variables

Connection details are automatically injected as environment variables. See [Environment Variables](/configuration/environment-variables).

### SSH Access

Access running containers via SSH using the [Qovery CLI](/cli/commands/shell):

```bash
qovery shell
```

### Clone Service

Duplicate an application configuration to the same or different environment. Cloning copies:
- General configuration
- Resource settings
- Port configuration
- Storage configuration
- Build settings

<Note>
Cloning excludes custom domains and some built-in environment variables to prevent conflicts.
</Note>

### Advanced Settings

Configure advanced options including:
- Build timeout and resources
- Deployment strategy
- Network settings
- Node affinity
- Annotations and labels

See [Service Advanced Settings](/configuration/service-advanced-settings) for details.

### Delete Application

To delete an application:

1. Navigate to application settings
2. Click **Delete Application**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleting an application is permanent and cannot be undone. All associated data and configurations will be removed.
</Warning>
