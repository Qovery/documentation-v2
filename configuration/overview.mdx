description: "Complete guide to configuring and managing your infrastructure with Qovery"
---

Qovery provides comprehensive configuration options to manage every aspect of your infrastructure, from organization-level settings to individual service configurations. This section covers all configuration capabilities available on the platform.

## Configuration Hierarchy

Qovery uses a hierarchical structure to organize your infrastructure:

    [Start deploying →](/guides/qovery-101/deploy)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuring a Production Environment" icon="building">
    **Production checklist**:

    - ✅ Use managed Kubernetes cluster with HA
    - ✅ Configure resource limits and auto-scaling
    - ✅ Set up health checks and readiness probes

  <Accordion title="Managing Multiple Environments" icon="layer-group">
    **Multi-environment strategy**:

    1. **Development** - Fast iteration, auto-deploy, minimal resources
    2. **Staging** - Production parity, manual deploys, full testing
    3. **Production** - High availability, controlled deploys, monitoring

    **Configuration differences**:
    - Environment variables (API endpoints, feature flags)
    - Resource allocation (CPU, memory)
    - Scaling rules (replicas, auto-scaling)
    - Deployment strategy (auto vs manual)
    - Backup and monitoring settings

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Migrating Configuration Between Environments" icon="arrows-left-right">
    **Migration methods**:

    1. **Clone Environment** - Copy entire environment configuration
    2. **Export/Import** - Use CLI or API to export and import config
    3. **Terraform** - Define environments as code for consistency
    4. **Blueprint Pattern** - Create templates for new environments

    **What gets migrated**:
    - Service configurations
    - Environment variables
    - Deployment settings
    - Network configuration
