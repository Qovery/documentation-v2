## Welcome to Qovery

Qovery is a DevOps Automation Platform that empowers developers to deploy and manage their applications on their own cloud infrastructure. Built for modern cloud-native development, Qovery provides everything you need to run production workloads at scale.

## The Qovery Platform

Qovery consists of five integrated products that work together to provide a complete platform solution:

## How Qovery Works

Qovery uses Kubernetes as a universal orchestrator to manage your applications and infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. The platform integrates five core products that work together seamlessly:

<img src="/images/qovery-architecture.svg" alt="Qovery Architecture - Five products (Provision, Deploy, Observe, Optimize, Secure) running on Kubernetes across AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Scaleway" />

This architecture allows you to:
- **Provision** infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters across any cloud provider
- **Deploy** applications, databases, and services with GitOps workflows
- **Observe** your entire stack with unified monitoring and logging
- **Optimize** costs and resources with intelligent recommendations
- **Secure** your infrastructure with built-in security and compliance

All orchestrated through Kubernetes, running on your own cloud infrastructure.

## Why Qovery?
