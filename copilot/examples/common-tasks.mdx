## Daily Operations

### Check Infrastructure Status

```
You: "Show me the status of all my environments"

Copilot: Lists all environments with their status, deployed services, and health
```

### Deploy Latest Changes

```
You: "Deploy the latest commit of my-api to staging"

Copilot:
1. Finds my-api application
2. Gets latest commit from main branch
3. Deploys to staging environment
4. Monitors deployment progress
5. Reports success
```

### Quick Service Restart

```
You: "Restart the frontend application"

Copilot: Triggers application redeploy and confirms when complete
```

## Environment Management

### Create Test Environment

```
You: "Create a new environment called feature-auth for testing"

Copilot:
1. Creates new environment
2. Configures default settings
3. Confirms creation
4. Provides environment details
```

### Clone for Testing

```
You: "Clone production to staging-test"

Copilot:
1. Reads production configuration
2. Creates staging-test environment
3. Clones all services
4. Adjusts resource allocations
5. Confirms setup complete
```

### Clean Up Old Environments

```
You: "Delete all environments starting with feature- that are older than 7 days"

Copilot:
1. Lists matching environments
2. Checks last activity dates
3. Identifies candidates for deletion
4. Asks for confirmation
5. Deletes approved environments
```

## Deployment Scenarios

### Deploy Specific Version

```
You: "Deploy version 2.1.0 of the backend to production"

Copilot:
1. Finds backend application
2. Locates version 2.1.0 tag
3. Deploys to production
4. Waits for health checks
5. Confirms successful deployment
```

### Multi-Service Deployment

```
You: "Deploy both API and frontend to staging"

Copilot:
1. Identifies both services
2. Deploys API first
3. Waits for API to be healthy
4. Deploys frontend
5. Verifies both services running
```

### Rollback Deployment

```
You: "Rollback the API to the previous version"

Copilot:
1. Identifies last working version
2. Initiates rollback deployment
3. Monitors rollback progress
4. Confirms previous version restored
```

## Resource Management

### Scale Services

```
You: "Scale the API service to 5 replicas"

Copilot:
1. Updates replica count
2. Triggers redeployment
3. Waits for all replicas to be ready
4. Confirms scaling complete
```

### Update Environment Variables

```
You: "Update the DATABASE_URL environment variable for my-api"

Copilot:
1. Prompts for new value
2. Updates environment variable
3. Asks if you want to redeploy
4. Redeployments if confirmed
```

## Monitoring & Investigation

### Check Application Logs

```
You: "Show me logs for the API from the last 30 minutes"

Copilot:
1. Retrieves logs from last 30 minutes
2. Displays formatted log entries
3. Highlights errors if present
```

### Investigate Errors

```
You: "Why is my deployment failing?"

Copilot:
1. Checks deployment status
2. Analyzes deployment logs
3. Identifies error cause
4. Suggests remediation steps
```

### Monitor Resource Usage

```
You: "Show me CPU and memory usage for production services"

Copilot:
1. Queries metrics for all production services
2. Displays current resource usage
3. Highlights services near limits
```

## Cost Management

### Analyze Spending

```
You: "Show me costs for the last month"

Copilot:
1. Retrieves usage data
2. Calculates costs per environment
3. Displays breakdown by service type
4. Shows trends
```

### Stop Unused Resources

```
You: "Stop all development environments overnight"

Copilot:
1. Identifies development environments
2. Schedules stop at end of day
3. Schedules start in morning
4. Confirms automation setup
```

## Database Operations

### Check Database Status

```
You: "Is the PostgreSQL database running?"

Copilot: Checks and reports database status with connection details
```

### Restart Database

```
You: "Restart the staging database"

Copilot:
1. Stops database service
2. Waits for graceful shutdown
3. Starts database service
4. Verifies database is healthy
```

## Configuration Management

### List Services

```
You: "What applications are deployed in production?"

Copilot: Lists all applications with their status and URLs
```

### Get Configuration Details

```
You: "Show me the configuration for my-api"

Copilot: Displays application settings, environment variables, resources, and networking
```

## Quick Wins

### One-Line Deployments

```
"Deploy latest to staging"
"Restart production"
"Stop dev environment"
```

### Status Checks

```
"Is everything healthy?"
"Show failing services"
"What's broken?"
```

### Batch Operations

```
"Restart all APIs"
"Scale down all dev services"
"Update env var across all environments"
```

## Tips for Effective Use

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific When Needed">
    **Good**: "Deploy my-api version 2.0 to production"

    **Less Clear**: "Deploy something"

    Copilot will ask for clarification if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Context">
    **Build on Previous**:
    - "Show production"
    - "Deploy latest there"
    - "Now check if it's healthy"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine Operations">
    **Single Request**: "Deploy to staging, wait for health check, then promote to production"

    Copilot handles the entire workflow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask for Explanations">
    - "Why did that fail?"
    - "What does this error mean?"
    - "How do I fix this?"

    Copilot provides context and guidance
