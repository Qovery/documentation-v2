## Multi-Step Deployments

### Progressive Deployment Pipeline

```
You: "Deploy the new version to dev, then staging, then production - but only if tests pass at each stage"

Copilot:
1. Deploys to dev environment
2. Runs automated tests
3. If tests pass, deploys to staging
4. Runs staging tests
5. Waits for approval before production
6. Deploys to production
7. Monitors production health
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

```
You: "Set up a blue-green deployment for my-api in production"

Copilot:
1. Creates green environment (copy of blue)
2. Deploys new version to green
3. Runs health checks on green
4. Switches traffic to green
5. Monitors for issues
6. Keeps blue as backup
```

### Canary Deployment

```
You: "Deploy version 2.0 as a canary to 10% of production traffic"

Copilot:
1. Deploys new version alongside current
2. Configures traffic split (90% old, 10% new)
3. Monitors error rates
4. Gradually increases traffic if healthy
5. Rolls back if errors spike
```

## Complex Infrastructure Changes

### Multi-Environment Setup

```
You: "Create a complete staging infrastructure that mirrors production but with half the resources"

Copilot:
1. Analyzes production infrastructure
2. Creates staging environment
3. Clones all services
4. Reduces resource allocations by 50%
5. Adjusts database sizes
6. Configures networking
7. Sets up monitoring
8. Validates complete setup
```

### Infrastructure Migration

```
You: "Migrate all staging environments from cluster-east to cluster-west"

Copilot:
1. Lists all staging environments
2. For each environment:
   - Creates new environment in cluster-west
   - Deploys all services
   - Migrates data
   - Validates functionality
   - Switches DNS/routing
   - Deletes old environment
3. Reports migration summary
```

## Automated Optimization

### Cost Optimization Workflow

```
You: "Analyze my infrastructure and implement cost savings where possible"

Copilot:
1. Analyzes all environments
2. Identifies underutilized resources
3. Finds idle services
4. Suggests optimizations:
   - Right-size over-provisioned services
   - Stop inactive environments
   - Use spot instances where appropriate
   - Consolidate low-traffic services
5. Implements approved optimizations
6. Reports projected monthly savings
```

### Performance Optimization

```
You: "Optimize the performance of my production stack"

Copilot:
1. Analyzes performance metrics
2. Identifies bottlenecks
3. Reviews configurations
4. Suggests improvements:
   - Increase resources for constrained services
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add caching layers
   - Adjust auto-scaling rules
5. Implements approved changes
6. Monitors impact
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backup and Restore

```
You: "Backup production, make breaking changes to staging, then restore if needed"

Copilot:
1. Takes snapshot of production state
2. Applies changes to staging
3. Monitors for issues
4. If problems detected:
   - Automatically restores from snapshot
   - Documents what went wrong
   - Suggests fixes
```

### Multi-Region Failover

```
You: "If production goes down, automatically failover to DR region"

Copilot:
1. Monitors production health
2. If failure detected:
   - Validates DR environment is healthy
   - Switches DNS to DR region
   - Notifies team
   - Provides status dashboard
3. When production recovers:
   - Syncs data
   - Fails back to primary
```

## Batch Operations

### Bulk Environment Management

```
You: "For all feature branches older than 2 weeks: stop them if inactive, delete them if older than 1 month"

Copilot:
1. Lists all feature branch environments
2. Checks last activity for each
3. Categorizes by age and activity
4. Stops inactive 2-week-old environments
5. Deletes 1-month-old environments
6. Generates cleanup report
7. Calculates cost savings
```

### Mass Configuration Updates

```
You: "Update the API_VERSION environment variable to 2.0 across all environments"

Copilot:
1. Lists all environments
2. For each environment:
   - Finds services with API_VERSION
   - Updates value to 2.0
   - Triggers redeployment
   - Waits for healthy status
3. Reports success/failures
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Release Pipeline

```
You: "When a new tag is pushed, automatically deploy to staging, run tests, and notify Slack"

Copilot:
1. Sets up webhook for new tags
2. On tag event:
   - Deploys to staging
   - Waits for deployment
   - Runs integration tests
   - If tests pass:
     - Notifies Slack with success
     - Creates production deployment plan
   - If tests fail:
     - Rolls back staging
     - Notifies Slack with failure details
     - Logs for review
```

### Hotfix Workflow

```
You: "I need to deploy a hotfix immediately - bypass normal pipeline"

Copilot:
1. Identifies hotfix branch
2. Creates emergency deployment plan
3. Deploys directly to production
4. Monitors closely for issues
5. Documents hotfix deployment
6. Reminds to backport to main
```

## Data Migration

### Zero-Downtime Migration

```
You: "Migrate the database from PostgreSQL 13 to 15 with zero downtime"

Copilot:
1. Creates new PostgreSQL 15 database
2. Sets up replication from old to new
3. Monitors replication lag
4. When in sync:
   - Switches application to new database
   - Monitors for errors
   - Keeps old database as backup
5. After validation period:
   - Removes old database
   - Updates documentation
```

Copilot:
1. Identifies deleted environments
2. Locates associated data
3. Creates archive storage
4. Exports data to archive
5. Verifies archive integrity
6. Removes from active storage
7. Updates inventory
```

## Compliance & Auditing

### Compliance Scan

```
You: "Audit all production services for security compliance"

Copilot:
1. Scans all production services
2. Checks:
   - Environment variables not hardcoded
   - No public database access
   - HTTPS enforced
   - Secrets properly managed
   - Latest security patches applied
3. Generates compliance report
4. Flags violations
5. Suggests remediations
```

### Access Review

```
You: "Review who has access to production and ensure least privilege"

Copilot:
1. Lists all users with production access
2. Reviews access levels
3. Identifies overly permissive access
4. Suggests access reductions
5. Generates access audit report
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Proactive Issue Detection

```
You: "Monitor production and automatically fix common issues"

Copilot:
1. Monitors production continuously
2. Detects patterns like:
   - Memory leaks (restart affected services)
   - Connection pool exhaustion (scale up)
   - Failed health checks (redeploy)
3. Automatically remediates known issues
4. Notifies of actions taken
5. Escalates unknown issues
```

### Intelligent Alerting

```
You: "Alert me only for critical issues, auto-handle everything else"

Copilot:
1. Monitors all infrastructure
2. Categorizes issues by severity
3. Auto-remediates:
   - Low: Service restarts, scaling adjustments
   - Medium: Failovers, traffic rerouting
4. Alerts for:
   - High: Data corruption, security issues
   - Critical: Complete outages, data breaches
5. Provides context and suggested actions
```

## Best Practices for Complex Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Break Down Complex Requests">
    For very complex workflows, break them into phases:

    1. "First, set up the infrastructure..."
    2. "Next, configure the services..."
    3. "Finally, validate everything..."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Checkpoints">
    Request confirmation at critical points:

    "Deploy to staging, wait for my approval, then continue to production"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Success Criteria">
    Be explicit about what success looks like:

    "Deploy and consider it successful only if error rate stays below 0.1%"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan for Failures">
    Include failure handling in your requests:

    "Try to deploy, but if it fails, automatically rollback and notify me"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
