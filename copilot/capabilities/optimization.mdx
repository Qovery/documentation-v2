## Overview

Qovery AI Copilot helps you optimize infrastructure costs, resource usage, and application configurations through intelligent analysis and recommendations.

## Cost Optimization

### Analyze Costs

```
"Show me monthly spending"
"What are my highest cost services?"
"Analyze costs for the last 30 days"
"Compare costs between staging and production"
```

### Identify Savings

```
"Find underutilized resources"
"Which environments are costing the most?"
"Show me idle services"
"Identify cost-saving opportunities"
```

### Automate Cost Reduction

```
"Stop all non-production environments for the weekend"
"Shut down inactive environments"
"Scale down development services overnight"
```

## Resource Optimization

### Analyze Resource Usage

```
"Show CPU usage across all services"
"What services are using the most memory?"
"Analyze resource utilization"
"Find over-provisioned services"
```

### Right-Size Resources

```
"Optimize resource allocation for my-api"
"Suggest better CPU/memory settings"
"Right-size all development services"
```

### Scaling Recommendations

```
"Should I scale up or down?"
"Recommend optimal instance count"
"Analyze scaling patterns"
```

## Configuration Optimization

### Dockerfile Optimization

```
"Optimize this Dockerfile"
"Suggest improvements for my Docker build"
"Review Dockerfile best practices"
```

### Application Configuration

```
"Review environment variables"
"Optimize application settings"
"Suggest performance improvements"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Identify Bottlenecks

```
"Find performance bottlenecks"
"What's slowing down my application?"
"Analyze response times"
```

### Optimization Recommendations

```
"Suggest performance improvements"
"How can I make deployments faster?"
"Optimize build times"
```

## Inactive Resource Management

### Find Inactive Resources

```
"Show environments inactive for 24 hours"
"List unused databases"
"Find idle applications"
```

### Clean Up Resources

```
"Stop all inactive staging environments"
"Delete unused test environments"
"Clean up old deployments"
```

## Usage Analytics

### Generate Reports

```
"Generate usage stats for last month"
"Show deployment frequency"
