## Overview

Automate application deployments, manage services, and handle deployment workflows through natural language with Qovery AI Copilot.

## Application Deployment

### Deploy Applications

### Redeploy Applications

```
"Redeploy the frontend application"
"Restart the API service"
"Redeploy all services in production"
```

### Stop Applications

```
"Stop the backend application"
"Stop all services in development"
"Shut down the staging environment"
```

## Service Management

### List Services

```
"Show me all applications"
"List services in production"
"What's running in staging?"
"Show all databases"
```

### Scale Services

```
"Scale the API to 5 replicas"
"Increase frontend instances to 3"
"Scale down the worker service"
```

### Update Configurations
