## Technical Decisions

1. **Mintlify Components**: Extensive use of Card, CardGroup, Tabs, Steps, Accordion
2. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Used for architecture visualization with brand colors
3. **Support Matrices**: Structured tables for capability tracking
4. **Brand Colors**: Purple palette (#642DFF primary) with extended variations
5. **Custom CSS**: Minimal, focused on icon sizing and spacing
6. **Individual CLI Pages**: Better navigation and SEO (matches API Reference pattern)
