Clusters in Qovery are Kubernetes clusters that run your applications, databases, and services. Qovery supports multi-cloud deployments across AWS, GCP, Azure, and Scaleway, providing a unified interface to manage infrastructure regardless of the underlying cloud provider.

## Overview

A cluster is the foundational infrastructure where all your environments and services run. Qovery handles the complexity of Kubernetes cluster management, including:

- Automated cluster provisioning
- Node management and auto-scaling
- Kubernetes version upgrades
- Security patching and vulnerability management
- Load balancing and networking
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost optimization

**Supported Cloud Providers**:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure
- Scaleway

## Creating a Cluster

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Cluster">
    Navigate to your organization settings and click **Add Cluster**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Cloud Provider">
    Select your cloud provider:
    - **AWS**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
    - **GCP**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
    - **Azure**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    - **Scaleway**: Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Credentials">
    Provide cloud provider credentials:
    - AWS: IAM access keys or role ARN
    - GCP: Service account key
    - Azure: Service principal credentials
    - Scaleway: API keys
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Cluster Settings">
    - **Cluster Name**: Unique identifier
    - **Region**: Cloud provider region
    - **Kubernetes Version**: K8s version to deploy
    - **Node Configuration**: Instance types and sizes
    - **Auto-scaling**: Enable/disable node auto-scaling
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review your configuration and click **Create Cluster**. Provisioning typically takes 15-30 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Cluster creation is a one-time process. Once created, Qovery manages the cluster lifecycle, including updates and maintenance.

### Access Kubeconfig

Download Kubernetes configuration for direct cluster access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Kubeconfig">
    Click on cluster → **Actions** → **Get Kubeconfig**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Save the kubeconfig file to `~/.kube/config` or a custom location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use with kubectl">
    ```bash
    # Using default location
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

    # Using custom location
    kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/config get pods
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Security Considerations**:
- Kubeconfig provides cluster-admin access
- Store securely, never commit to Git
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Use RBAC for team access instead

<Warning>
Direct cluster access should be used sparingly. Qovery provides safer interfaces for most operations. Use kubectl only for debugging or advanced operations.
</Warning>

## Custom Domain with Cloudflare (Beta)

Configure wildcard TLS certificates using Cloudflare:

### Prerequisites

    - Provide Cloudflare API token
    - Select Cloudflare zone
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify DNS">
    Qovery will create required DNS records:
    - `*.myapp.com` pointing to cluster load balancer
    - TXT records for certificate validation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Certificate Provisioning">
    - Wildcard TLS certificate is automatically provisioned
    - Certificate auto-renewal configured
    - All applications can use custom subdomains
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Benefits**:

Cluster 1: Production (isolated)
Cluster 2: Staging + Development
Cluster 3: CI/CD and Preview Environments
```

**Multi-Cloud Strategy**:
```
Cluster 1: AWS (Primary production)
Cluster 2: GCP (Backup and DR)
Cluster 3: Azure (Specific workloads)
```

### Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Tag clusters by purpose and environment
- Centralize monitoring across clusters
- Implement cross-cluster networking if needed
- Document cluster purposes and owners
