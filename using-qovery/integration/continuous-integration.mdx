## Integration Approaches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Qovery Deploy (Recommended)" icon="star">
    **Zero Configuration Required**

    Qovery automatically builds your application from Git:
    - Detects Dockerfile or builds from source
    - Manages container registry
    - Handles build caching
    - No CI/CD configuration needed

    Best for: Teams wanting simplicity and zero maintenance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="External CI/CD Build" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Custom Build Pipeline**

    Use your existing CI/CD to build images:
    - Full control over build process
    - Custom build steps and testing
    - Push images to container registry
    - Qovery deploys the pre-built images

    Best for: Teams with existing CI/CD infrastructure
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hybrid Approach" icon="shuffle">
    **Mix Both Methods**

    Use different approaches per environment:
    - Qovery Deploy for dev/staging (fast iteration)
    - CI/CD pipeline for production (strict controls)

    Best for: Teams needing flexibility
  </Accordion>
