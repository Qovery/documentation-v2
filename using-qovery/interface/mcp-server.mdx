**Documentation Moved**: Complete MCP Server documentation, setup instructions, and usage guides are now available in the [Copilot section](/copilot/mcp-server).

This page provides a brief overview. For detailed setup, configuration, and troubleshooting, visit the [Copilot MCP Server page](/copilot/mcp-server).
</Note>

## Overview

The Qovery MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables AI assistants like Claude Desktop to interact with your Qovery infrastructure through the **Qovery AI Copilot** - an agentic AI system designed specifically for DevOps automation. This integration allows you to manage deployments, troubleshoot issues, and query infrastructure status through natural language conversations.

<Info>
The Qovery MCP Server is powered by the **Qovery AI Copilot**, an agentic agent that understands DevOps workflows and can autonomously execute complex infrastructure tasks. [Learn more →](/copilot/overview)
</Info>

**Key Features**:
- **Agentic AI**: Not just a chatbot - the Copilot can plan and execute multi-step operations autonomously
- **DevOps Intelligence**: Built-in understanding of deployment workflows, troubleshooting, and best practices
- **MCP Integration**: Uses the open Model Context Protocol developed by Anthropic
- **Production-Ready**: Designed for real-world DevOps automation, not just queries

## Qovery AI Copilot: An Agentic Approach

Unlike traditional chatbots that simply answer questions, the Qovery AI Copilot is an **agentic AI system** that can:

- **Plan**: Break down complex requests into actionable steps
- **Execute**: Autonomously perform multiple operations to achieve goals
- **Reason**: Understand context and make intelligent decisions
- **Learn**: Adapt to your infrastructure patterns and preferences
- **Troubleshoot**: Analyze logs, metrics, and events to diagnose issues

The Copilot uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to communicate with AI assistants, enabling natural language control over your infrastructure while maintaining the intelligence needed for production DevOps workflows.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to:
- Access external tools and APIs
- Read and write data from various sources
- Execute commands in connected systems
- Provide context-aware responses

The Qovery MCP Server bridges the Qovery AI Copilot with MCP-compatible AI assistants, giving you conversational control over your entire DevOps infrastructure.

## Quick Start

For complete installation instructions, visit the [MCP Server Setup page](/copilot/mcp-server).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+
- Qovery API token
- Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible client

### Basic Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install MCP Server">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @qovery/mcp-server
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
    Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qovery": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@qovery/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "QOVERY_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

Generate an API token from the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com):

1. Navigate to Organization Settings → API Tokens
2. Click "Generate Token"
3. Copy the token
4. Add to your MCP configuration

<Warning>
Keep your API token secure. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with Qovery through natural language:

### Deployment

```
You: Deploy the latest version of my API application to production

AI: I'll deploy the api application in the production environment.
    Let me trigger the deployment...

    ✓ Deployment started for api (version: main@abc123)
    ✓ Building container image...
    ✓ Deployment successful

    Your API is now live at https://api.example.com
```

### Status Checking

```
You: What's the status of my production environment?

AI: Here's the status of your production environment:

    Applications:
    - api: Running (3 replicas, CPU: 45%, Memory: 1.2GB)
    - frontend: Running (2 replicas, CPU: 20%, Memory: 512MB)
    - worker: Running (1 replica, CPU: 60%, Memory: 2.1GB)

    Databases:
    - postgres-main: Running (PostgreSQL 15, 50GB storage)
    - redis-cache: Running (Redis 7, 2GB memory)

    All services are healthy.
```

### Troubleshooting

```
You: My API deployment is failing. Can you help me debug it?

AI: Let me check the deployment logs for your API...

    I found the issue. Your deployment is failing because:

    1. Container image build failed at line 15 of your Dockerfile
    2. Missing environment variable: DATABASE_URL
    3. Health check is timing out (30s limit exceeded)

    Recommendations:
    - Fix the Dockerfile syntax error on line 15
    - Add DATABASE_URL to your environment variables
    - Increase health check timeout to 60s or optimize startup time

    Would you like me to show you the full error logs?
```

### Resource Management

```
You: Create a staging environment with a PostgreSQL database

AI: I'll create a staging environment for you with PostgreSQL...

    ✓ Created environment: staging
    ✓ Created PostgreSQL database: staging-db (version 15)
    ✓ Configured automatic backups (daily, 7-day retention)

    Database connection details have been automatically injected
    as environment variables for your applications.

    Your staging environment is ready at: https://staging.example.com
```

### Scaling

```
You: Scale my API to 5 replicas

AI: I'll scale the api application to 5 replicas...

    ✓ Scaling from 3 to 5 replicas
    ✓ New pods starting...
    ✓ Health checks passing
    ✓ Load balancer updated

    Your API is now running with 5 replicas.
    Current resource usage: CPU: 35%, Memory: 2.8GB total
```

  </Card>

  <Card title="Future Integrations" icon="sparkles">
    More assistants coming soon
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Important Security Notes**:
- API tokens grant full access to your Qovery organization
- Use read-only tokens when possible for query-only operations
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor API usage for suspicious activity
- Never share tokens or configuration files
</Warning>

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Scoped Tokens">
    Create API tokens with minimal required permissions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Variables">
    Store tokens in environment variables, not configuration files
  </Step>

  <Step title="Audit Logs">
    Regularly review API access logs in Qovery Console
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rotate Tokens">
    Rotate API tokens every 90 days or when team members leave
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

### DevOps Automation

```
"Create a preview environment for PR #123 with the api and frontend
applications, using a PostgreSQL database. Set auto-delete to 7 days."
```

### Incident Response

```
"Production API is down. Show me the last 100 error logs, current
resource usage, and recent deployments."
```

### Infrastructure Queries

```
"What's our total cloud spend this month? Show me a breakdown by
environment and service type."
```

### Team Collaboration

```
"Clone the production environment to staging and update the database
to use a smaller instance type."
```
