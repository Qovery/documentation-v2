## Overview

Managing production environments requires robust infrastructure, high availability, security, and comprehensive monitoring. Qovery provides the tools and features to ensure your production workloads run reliably and securely.

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Production Cluster Required**: Before following this guide, you need a Kubernetes cluster flagged as **Production** in Qovery.
</Warning>

**Don't have a cluster yet?**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Managed Cluster (Recommended)" icon="cloud" href="/quickstart/cloud">
    Let Qovery provision and manage your production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Scaleway
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bring Your Own Cluster (BYOK)" icon="server" href="/integrations/kubernetes/byok">
    Connect your existing Kubernetes cluster
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
When creating your cluster:
- Flag it as **Production** environment type
- Use production-grade instance types (minimum 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- Enable multi-AZ deployment for high availability
</Info>

## Key Production Features

## Production Setup

### 1. Application Configuration

Deploy your application and configure it for production.

<Card title="Deploy Your First Application" icon="rocket" href="/guides/getting-started/deploy-your-first-application">
  Follow the guide to deploy your application to production
</Card>

**Production application settings**:
- Enable **Auto-Scaling** to handle traffic spikes
- Set appropriate **resource limits** (CPU and memory)
- Configure **health checks** (liveness and readiness probes)
- Set up **custom domains** with SSL/TLS

### 2. Database Configuration

Configure your production database with backups and high availability.

<Card title="Connect Database" icon="database" href="/guides/getting-started/connect-database">
  Follow the guide to set up and connect your database
</Card>

**Production database recommendations**:
- Use **Managed** mode for automatic backups and maintenance
- Enable **Multi-AZ** for high availability (cloud provider feature)
- Configure backup retention via your cloud provider
- Use strong passwords and restrict access

### 3. Environment Variables & Secrets

Securely manage your production configuration.

<Card title="Environment Variables" icon="key" href="/configuration/environment-variables">
  Configure variables and secrets for your applications
</Card>

**Best practices**:
- Use **Secrets** type for sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use environment-specific variables
- Consider [Doppler integration](/integrations/secret-managers/doppler) for advanced secret management

### 4. Access Control

Configure role-based access control for your team.

<Card title="RBAC Configuration" icon="user-lock" href="/configuration/organization/members-rbac">
  Set up roles and permissions for your organization
</Card>

**Production access**:
- Limit production access to essential team members
- Use custom roles with specific permissions
- Enable MFA for all production users
- Regular access reviews

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring

Qovery provides built-in observability for your production applications.

<Card title="Qovery Observe" icon="chart-mixed" href="/guides/qovery-101/observe">
  Access logs, metrics, and monitoring for your services
</Card>

**Available features**:
- **Logs**: 12-week retention with Loki
- **Metrics**: Prometheus and Thanos for monitoring
- **Service Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, and application metrics
- **Events**: Track deployments and service events

## Deployment Strategy

Configure your deployment pipeline for production.
