## Overview

Qovery Observe provides built-in observability for your applications and infrastructure, offering a middle ground between expensive SaaS monitoring tools and complex DIY observability stacks. Your data stays in your infrastructure with zero maintenance required, while you get a developer and ops-friendly interface for monitoring service health, performance, and behavior.

<Note>
Qovery Observe is currently available for AWS, GCP, and Scaleway clusters. Azure support is coming soon. Currently supports Applications and Containers, with more service types coming.
</Note>

<Info>
Qovery Observe is not yet self-service. If you're interested in using this feature, please contact Qovery via Slack or email to get access.

### Using Qovery CLI for Logs

You can also access logs via the [Qovery CLI](/cli/overview):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stream Logs">
    ```bash
    # Stream logs from application
    qovery log --follow

    # Stream logs from specific environment
    qovery log --environment production --follow

    # Filter by service
    qovery log --application backend-api --follow
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Search Historical Logs">
    ```bash
    # View last 100 log lines
    qovery log --tail 100

    # Search logs with filter
    qovery log --grep "ERROR"

    # View logs from specific time range
    qovery log --since 1h
    qovery log --since "2024-01-15 10:00:00"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Export Logs">
    ```bash
    # Export logs to file
    qovery log --since 24h > application-logs.txt

## Available Metrics

Qovery Observe automatically collects and displays key infrastructure metrics:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="CPU Usage" icon="microchip">
    Current CPU utilization percentage and trends over time
  </Card>

  <Card title="Memory Usage" icon="memory">
    Current memory consumption, limits, and usage patterns
  </Card>

  <Card title="Network Usage" icon="network-wired">
    Inbound and outbound network traffic metrics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Understanding Metrics

**CPU Usage**:
- Shows current CPU utilization as a percentage
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks
- Useful for right-sizing resource allocations

**Memory Usage**:
- Displays current memory consumption
- Shows memory limits and available headroom
- Helps prevent OOM (Out of Memory) errors

**Network Usage**:
- Tracks inbound and outbound traffic
- Helps identify network-related issues
- Useful for monitoring data transfer costs

## Troubleshooting with Qovery Observe

### Debugging with Logs

When troubleshooting issues, use logs to:

1. **Identify Error Patterns**: Search for ERROR or WARN level logs
2. **Trace Request Flow**: Follow request IDs through your application
3. **Analyze Performance**: Look for slow queries or high latency operations
4. **Monitor Deployment Issues**: Check logs during and after deployments

### Analyzing Metrics

Use metrics to diagnose issues:

1. **High CPU Usage**: May indicate computational bottlenecks or infinite loops
2. **Memory Leaks**: Gradual memory increase over time without release
3. **Network Issues**: Unusual traffic patterns or connection errors

### Monitoring Events

Check Kubernetes events to understand:

1. **Pod Failures**: Why pods are crashing or failing to start
2. **Scheduling Issues**: Resource constraints preventing pod scheduling
3. **Scaling Events**: When and why auto-scaling triggered

## CLI Tools for Observability

### Shell Access

Access running containers for debugging using the [shell command](/cli/commands/shell):

```bash
# Open interactive shell
qovery shell

# Execute single command
qovery shell --command "ps aux"

# Connect to specific instance
qovery shell --instance 2
```

### Port Forwarding

Access services locally for debugging using [port forwarding](/cli/commands/port-forward):

```bash
# Forward application port
qovery port-forward --port 3000

# Forward database port
qovery port-forward --service postgres-db --port 5432
```

### Status Monitoring

Check service health and status using the [status command](/cli/commands/status):

```bash
# View environment status
qovery status

# View specific application status
qovery status --application backend-api
```
