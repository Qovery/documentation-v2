Deploy a containerized application on Qovery in minutes. This guide walks you through creating and deploying your first application from a Git repository.

## Prerequisites

<Check>Qovery account - [Sign up here](https://console.qovery.com/signup)</Check>
<Check>Git repository with your application code (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)</Check>

## Step 1: Create a Project

[Projects](/configuration/project) organize your applications and environments.

**Two ways to create a project:**

**Option A - From Project Selector (Quick):**
1. In [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com), click the **Project selector** in the header
2. Click **New** button
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "My First Project")
4. Click **Create**

**Option B - From Organization Settings:**
1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Projects** section
3. Click **Create Project**
4. Enter project details
5. Click **Create**

</Frame>

## Step 2: Create an Environment

[Environments](/configuration/environment) represent deployment stages (production, staging, development).

1. Open your project
2. Click **Create Environment**
3. Enter an environment name (e.g., "production")
4. Select the environment type (PRODUCTION, STAGING, or DEVELOPMENT)
5. Select the cluster where you want to deploy
6. Click **Create**

</Frame>

## Step 3: Create Your Application

Now let's deploy your application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Application Creation">
    In your environment, click **New Service** → **Create application**

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/configuration/environment/create_service.png" alt="Click New Service to create an application" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
    **Application Name**: Enter a name for your application

    **Application Source**: Choose your deployment method:
    - **Git Repository** (recommended for most cases)
    - **Container Registry** (if you have pre-built images)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Source">
    **For Git Repository:**
    - Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
    - Choose your repository
    - Select the branch to deploy (e.g., `main`)
    - Set root application path if needed

    <Info>
    Need to connect your Git provider? See [Git Repository Access](/configuration/organization/git-repository-access) for GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket setup.
    </Info>

    **For Container Registry:**
    - Select your registry
    - Enter image name and tag
    - **Important**: Use unique tags (avoid `latest`, `dev`, `master`)

    <Info>
    Need to connect a container registry? See [Container Registry](/configuration/organization/container-registry) for Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR, and other registries.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allocate Resources">
    Set compute resources for your application:

    - **vCPU**: Default 500m (0.5 core) - adjust as needed
    - **RAM**: Default 512 MB - adjust as needed
    - **Instances**: Min and max for auto-scaling (default: 1-1)

    <Tip>
    Start with defaults and scale up based on actual usage.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Ports">
    If your application serves traffic:

    - **Port**: The port your app listens on (e.g., 8080, 3000)
    - **Protocol**: Select HTTPS, gRPC, TCP, or UDP
    - **Publicly Accessible**: Enable to expose to the internet
    - **External Port**: 443 for HTTPS

    <Warning>
    Make sure your application listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` not just `localhost`.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Health Checks">
    Set up health checks for reliability:

    - **Liveness Probe**: Checks if app is running
    - **Readiness Probe**: Checks if app is ready for traffic

    Configure based on your declared ports and endpoints.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Environment Variables (Optional)">
    Add any environment variables your application needs:

    - Configuration values
    - API keys (use secrets for sensitive data)
    - Feature flags

    <Info>
    You can add these later in the application settings.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Deploy">
    Review your configuration, then:

    - Click **Create and Deploy** to deploy immediately
    - Or **Create** to deploy later

    Your application will start deploying!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitor Your Deployment

Watch your application come to life:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Deployment Progress">
    Click on your application to see:
    - **Build logs**: Container image creation
    - **Deployment logs**: Kubernetes deployment status
    - **Application logs**: Your app's output

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/deployment/deployment_logs_view.png" alt="View deployment logs in real-time" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Running Status">
    Deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes.

    Status progression: `Building` → `Deploying` → `Running`

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/deployment/deployment_status.png" alt="Application deployment status" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Application">
    Once running, click the application URL to view your live app!

    The URL format: `https://your-app-xxx.qovery.io`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happened Behind the Scenes

Qovery automatically:

1. ✅ Cloned your Git repository
2. ✅ Built a container image
3. ✅ Pushed to container registry
4. ✅ Deployed to Kubernetes
5. ✅ Configured networking with HTTPS
6. ✅ Started health checks

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build Failed">
    **Check**:
    - All dependencies listed in package manager file
    - Dockerfile syntax (if custom)
    - Build logs for specific errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Application Crashes">
    **Check**:
    - Application logs for errors
    - Environment variables are correct
    - Port configuration matches your app
    - Resource limits (CPU/memory) are sufficient
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Access Application">
    **Check**:
    - "Publicly Accessible" is enabled
    - App listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` not `localhost`
    - Health checks are passing
    - Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
  </Accordion>

## Quick Tips

<Tip>
**Start Small**: Begin with minimal resources (500m CPU, 512MB RAM) and scale based on actual usage.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use Health Checks**: Configure `/health` or `/healthz` endpoints in your app for better reliability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Enable Auto Deploy**: For development environments, enable auto-deploy to automatically deploy on Git push.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Check Logs First**: When troubleshooting, always check application logs - they contain valuable debugging information.
</Tip>
