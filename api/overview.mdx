## Overview

The Qovery API is a RESTful API that allows you to programmatically manage your entire infrastructure. Build custom integrations, automate workflows, and extend Qovery's functionality to fit your needs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.qovery.com
```

## API Specifications

The Qovery API follows these standards:

- **REST** - Resource-based URLs with standard HTTP methods
- **JSON** - Request and response bodies use JSON format
- **Authentication** - Bearer token authentication
- **Versioning** - API version included in URL path
- **Rate Limiting** - 1000 requests per hour per token

## Available Resources

The API provides access to all Qovery resources:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Organizations** | Manage organization settings and members |
| **Projects** | Create and manage projects |
| **Environments** | Deploy and manage environments |
| **Applications** | Deploy containerized applications |
| **Databases** | Provision and manage databases |
| **Containers** | Deploy generic containers |
| **Jobs** | Manage cron and lifecycle jobs |
| **Clusters** | Configure Kubernetes clusters |
| **Environment Variables** | Manage secrets and configuration |
| **Deployment Rules** | Configure deployment automation |

## Response Format

All API responses follow this structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "id": "resource-id",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  ...
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Validation error: name is required"
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `204` | No Content (success with no body) |
| `400` | Bad Request |
| `401` | Unauthorized |
| `403` | Forbidden |
| `404` | Not Found |
| `429` | Too Many Requests (rate limit) |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage:

- **1000 requests per hour** per API token
- Rate limit headers included in responses:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets (Unix timestamp)

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429` status code.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

```
GET /api/v1/projects?page=1&page_size=20
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "page_size": 20,
    "total_count": 150,
    "total_pages": 8
  }
}
```
