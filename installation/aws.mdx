## Create Your Cluster

Follow these steps to create your first Qovery cluster on AWS:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cluster Creation">
    1. Log into [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
    2. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Clusters**
    3. Click **Create Cluster**
    4. Select **AWS** as your cloud provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Cluster">
    - **Cluster name**: Choose a name like `production` or `my-first-cluster`
    - **Region**: Select the AWS region closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect AWS Account">
    **Setup secure access using CloudFormation:**

    1. Click the **CloudFormation link** shown in Qovery
    2. This opens AWS CloudFormation in a new tab (you'll be logged in automatically)
    3. In AWS CloudFormation:
       - Click **Next** (template is pre-filled)
       - Stack name: keep default or use `qovery-role`
       - Click **Next** twice
       - ✅ Check **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**
       - Click **Create stack**
    4. Wait ~1 minute until **Status: CREATE_COMPLETE**
    5. Go to the **Outputs** tab
    6. Copy the **RoleArn** value (starts with `arn:aws:iam::`)
    7. Back in Qovery, paste the Role ARN
    8. Give it a name like `AWS Production`
    9. Click **Save**

    <Tip>
    CloudFormation creates a secure IAM role for Qovery. This is safer than access keys because credentials are temporary and auto-rotated.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Instance Type">
    Select the size of your cluster nodes:

    - **t3.medium** (2 vCPU, 4GB) - Testing/dev
    - **t3.large** (2 vCPU, 8GB) - Light production ← **Recommended for starters**
    - **t3.xlarge** (4 vCPU, 16GB) - Standard production
    - **Custom** - Pick your own

    Don't worry - you can change this later!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review your settings and click **Create and Deploy**

    Your cluster will now be created automatically!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Wait for Cluster to Be Ready

**Cluster creation takes 20-30 minutes.** Here's what's happening:

| Step | Time | What's Being Created |
|------|------|---------------------|
| 1. Networking | 3-5 min | VPC, subnets, security groups |
| 2. EKS Control Plane | 10-15 min | Kubernetes master nodes |
| 3. Worker Nodes | 5-10 min | EC2 instances for your apps |
| 4. Qovery Components | 3-5 min | Ingress, monitoring, logging |

<Info>
**You'll receive an email when your cluster is ready!** Feel free to close this page.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CloudFormation stack fails">
    **Most common causes:**
    - AWS account doesn't have permissions to create IAM roles
    - AWS region doesn't support EKS

    **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as AWS admin or have IAM permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find the Role ARN">
    1. Go to AWS CloudFormation console
    2. Find your stack (status should be CREATE_COMPLETE)
    3. Click the **Outputs** tab
    4. Copy the value next to "RoleArn"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cluster creation is stuck">
    If your cluster stays in "Creating" status for more than 45 minutes:
    - Check AWS service quotas (especially EC2 instances)
    - Try a different AWS region
    - Contact support through Discord or email
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to use Access Keys instead">
    While we recommend CloudFormation for security, you can use static credentials:

    1. Create IAM user in AWS with AdministratorAccess
    2. Generate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
    3. In Qovery, select "Static Credentials" instead
    4. Enter your keys

    ⚠️ Remember to rotate these keys regularly (every 90 days).

## Understanding Your AWS Costs

Your cluster will cost approximately:

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| EKS control plane | $72 |
| 3x t3.large nodes | ~$150 |
| Load balancer | $20 |
| NAT gateway | $30 |
| **Total** | **~$270/month** |

<Tip>
**Save money:**
- Use **spot instances** (60-90% cheaper) for non-production
- Enable **auto-scaling** to use only what you need
- Stop dev/test clusters outside working hours
</Tip>
