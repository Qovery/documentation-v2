Install Qovery on your AWS account in less than 30 minutes. Qovery will create a Kubernetes cluster for you and manage it for you.

<Info>
To install Qovery on an existing Kubernetes cluster, please refer to the [Kubernetes installation guide](/installation/kubernetes).
</Info>

## Before You Begin

This guide assumes the following:

<Check>You have an account and an Organization on Qovery</Check>
<Check>You have an AWS account</Check>
<Check>You have AWS credentials with appropriate permissions</Check>

## Installation Overview

Qovery installation on AWS involves four main steps:

    B --> C[Select Options]
    C --> D[Deploy Cluster]
    D --> E[Ready to Deploy Apps]
```

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Cluster

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Cluster Creation">
    From your Qovery console, go to your organization settings and navigate to the **Clusters** section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click New Cluster">
    Click on **Create Cluster** button to start the cluster creation wizard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select AWS">
    Choose **AWS** as your cloud provider.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Cluster">
    Provide the following information:

    - **Cluster Name**: A unique name for your cluster (e.g., `production-cluster`)
    - **Description**: Optional description
    - **AWS Region**: Select your preferred AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
    - **Cluster Type**: Choose **Managed by Qovery** for automatic management
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can create multiple clusters on the same AWS account with different VPCs. You can also create multiple clusters on different AWS accounts. Qovery will manage them all for you.
</Note>

## Step 2: Attach AWS Credentials

Qovery needs AWS credentials to provision and manage resources in your AWS account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create IAM User">
    In your AWS console, create a new IAM user with programmatic access:

    1. Go to **IAM** > **Users** > **Add users**
    2. Enter user name: `qovery-admin`
    3. Select **Programmatic access**
    4. Attach the **AdministratorAccess** policy (or use custom policy with required permissions)
    5. Complete the user creation
    6. **Save** the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Credentials to Qovery">
    Back in the Qovery console:

    1. In the cluster creation wizard, click **Add Credentials**
    2. Enter your **AWS Access Key ID**
    3. Enter your **AWS Secret Access Key**
    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Credentials">
    Select the credentials you just created and click **Continue**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Store your AWS credentials securely. Qovery encrypts credentials at rest, but you should also keep a secure backup.
</Warning>

### Required IAM Permissions

If you prefer to use a custom IAM policy instead of AdministratorAccess, here are the required permissions:

<Accordion title="View Required IAM Permissions">
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "eks:*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:*",
        "autoscaling:*",
        "iam:*",
        "s3:*",
        "rds:*",
        "route53:*",
        "acm:*",
        "logs:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "ecr:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Select Your Options

Qovery provides multiple configuration options to customize your installation.

### Instance Type

## Cost Considerations

Your AWS costs will primarily consist of:

| Resource Type | Typical Monthly Cost | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| EKS Control Plane | $72 | Fixed cost per cluster |
| EC2 Instances | $100-500+ | Depends on instance type and count |
| Load Balancers | $20-30 | Per ALB |
| EBS Volumes | $10-50 | Depends on size and type |
| Data Transfer | Variable | Outbound data transfer costs |
| NAT Gateway | $30-45 | Per availability zone |

<Tip>
**Cost Optimization Tips:**
- Use spot instances for development environments
- Enable cluster auto-scaling to match actual demand
- Use deployment rules to stop dev environments outside working hours
- Monitor costs with AWS Cost Explorer
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installation Stuck or Failed">
    **Problem**: Installation doesn't complete or fails

    **Solutions**:
    - Check AWS service quotas (vCPUs, VPCs, Elastic IPs)
    - Verify IAM permissions are correct
    - Check AWS region availability
    - Contact Qovery support with cluster logs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AWS Quota Limits">
    **Problem**: "Quota exceeded" error

    **Solutions**:
    - Request quota increase in AWS Service Quotas console
    - Common limits: EC2 instances, Elastic IPs, VPCs
    - Contact AWS support for faster approval
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credential Issues">
    **Problem**: "Invalid credentials" or permission errors

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
    - Check IAM user has required permissions
