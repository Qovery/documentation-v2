- ✅ Automatic load balancing with SSL certificates
- ✅ Spot instance support for cost optimization
- ✅ Monitoring and logging built-in
- ✅ Ready to deploy your applications

### About Karpenter

Qovery uses [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) for intelligent node provisioning, which automatically selects the most cost-effective EC2 instances for your workloads:

**Key Benefits**:
- **60% cost savings** through spot instances and consolidation
- **Fast scaling** - Provisions nodes in seconds (vs minutes with traditional auto-scaling)
- **Smart instance selection** - Automatically chooses optimal instance types
- **Workload consolidation** - Packs pods efficiently to minimize node count

**How It Works**:
When you select an instance type (like t3.large), Karpenter uses it as a **baseline** but can provision other similar or better instances based on:
- Your application resource requirements
- Availability and pricing across multiple instance families
- Spot vs on-demand availability
- ARM vs x86 architecture preferences

<Info>
The instance type you choose during setup defines the **default node pool**. Karpenter can provision from a range of similar instances (t3, m5, m6i families) to optimize cost and availability.

## Create Your Cluster

Follow these steps to create your first Qovery cluster on AWS:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cluster Creation">
    1. Log into [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
    2. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Clusters**
    3. Click **Create Cluster**
    4. Select **AWS** as your cloud provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Cluster">
    - **Cluster name**: Choose a name like `production` or `my-first-cluster`
    - **Region**: Select the AWS region closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect AWS Account">
    Choose how to connect your AWS account to Qovery:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="STS Assume Role (Recommended)">
        **Most secure method** - Uses temporary credentials that auto-rotate. No access keys to manage.

        **What gets created**: A CloudFormation stack creates an IAM role with this policy:

        ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "eks:*",
                "iam:*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:*",
                "autoscaling:*",
                "logs:*",
                "s3:*"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        **Setup Steps**:

        1. **In Qovery Console**: Click the **CloudFormation link** shown
           - This opens AWS CloudFormation in a new tab (you're logged in automatically)

        2. **In AWS CloudFormation Console**:
           - Click **Next** (template is pre-filled with Qovery's requirements)
           - Stack name: Keep default `qovery-iam-role` or customize
           - Click **Next** (skip stack options)
           - Click **Next** again (skip tags)
           - ✅ **Important**: Check **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**
           - Click **Create stack**

        3. **Wait for completion** (~1 minute):
           - Status changes: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` → `CREATE_COMPLETE`
           - Refresh page if needed

        4. **Get the Role ARN**:
           - Click on the **Outputs** tab
           - Find **RoleArn** key
           - Copy the value (looks like: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/qovery-role`)

        5. **Complete in Qovery**:
           - Back in Qovery, paste the **Role ARN**
           - Give it a name like `AWS Production`
           - Click **Save**

        <Tip>
        **Why this is recommended**: The IAM role uses AWS STS (Security Token Service) to generate temporary credentials that automatically rotate. Qovery never has access to long-lived credentials, and you can revoke access instantly by deleting the CloudFormation stack.
        </Tip>

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="What permissions does Qovery need?">
            Qovery requires these AWS permissions to manage your infrastructure:
            - **EC2**: Create VPCs, subnets, security groups, and instances
            - **EKS**: Create and manage Kubernetes clusters
            - **IAM**: Create service roles for EKS and EC2
            - **ELB**: Create load balancers for your applications
            - **S3**: Store Terraform state and logs
            - **CloudWatch**: Collect logs and metrics

            You can review the full CloudFormation template before creating the stack.
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Can I use a custom IAM policy?">
            Yes! For production environments, you can create a custom IAM policy with minimum required permissions. Contact support for the minimal policy template.
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Static Credentials">
        **Alternative method** - Uses AWS Access Keys (requires manual rotation every 90 days).

        **What gets created**: An IAM user with AdministratorAccess policy and programmatic access keys.

        <Warning>
        **Security Note**: Static credentials don't expire and must be manually rotated. Only use this method if CloudFormation is not available in your AWS environment. For production, we strongly recommend STS Assume Role.
        </Warning>

        **Setup Steps**:

        1. **Open AWS IAM Console**:
           - Go to [IAM Users Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)
           - Click **Create user**

        2. **Create User**:
           - User name: `qovery-admin` (or your preferred name)
           - ⚠️ **Don't** check "Provide user access to AWS Management Console"
           - Click **Next**

        3. **Attach Permissions**:
           - Select **Attach policies directly**
           - Search for **AdministratorAccess**
           - ✅ Check the **AdministratorAccess** policy
           - Click **Next**

        4. **Review and Create**:
           - Review settings
           - Click **Create user**

           - Go to **Security credentials** tab
           - Scroll to **Access keys** section
           - Click **Create access key**

        6. **Select Use Case**:
           - Choose **Third-party service**
           - Check confirmation checkbox
           - Click **Next**
           - (Optional) Add description: "Qovery Production Access"
           - Click **Create access key**

        7. **Save Your Credentials** ⚠️:
           - Copy **Access Key ID** (looks like: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
           - Copy **Secret Access Key** (looks like: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)
           - **Download .csv file** as backup
           - ⚠️ **Important**: You can't view the secret key again after closing this page!

        8. **Complete in Qovery**:
           - Back in Qovery, select **Static Credentials** option
           - Paste **Access Key ID** in first field
           - Paste **Secret Access Key** in second field
           - Give it a name like `AWS Production`
           - Click **Save**

        <AccordionGroup>
          <Accordion title="How to rotate access keys (every 90 days)">
            1. Create a new access key for the same IAM user
            2. Update credentials in Qovery with new keys
            3. Wait 24 hours to ensure all systems use new keys
            4. Delete old access key in AWS IAM console
            5. Set calendar reminder for next rotation
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="What if I lost my secret access key?">
            AWS doesn't allow retrieving secret keys after creation. You must:
            1. Create a new access key pair
            2. Update Qovery with new credentials
            3. Delete the old access key
          </Accordion>

          <Accordion title="Can I use a less privileged IAM user?">
            Yes, but the user needs extensive permissions to manage EKS, EC2, VPC, IAM, and other AWS services. Contact support for a minimal IAM policy template. Note that restrictive policies may cause deployment failures.
          </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Instance Type">
    Select the baseline instance type for your cluster nodes:

    - **t3.medium** (2 vCPU, 4GB) - Testing/dev ($30/month per node)
    - **t3.large** (2 vCPU, 8GB) - Light production ($60/month) ← **Recommended**
    - **t3.xlarge** (4 vCPU, 16GB) - Standard production ($120/month)
    - **Custom** - Pick your own

    <Info>
    **Karpenter will optimize from here**: Your selected instance type is the baseline. Karpenter can provision similar instances (t3, m5, m6i families) based on workload needs and availability. Enable **spot instances** for 60-90% savings.
    </Info>

    Don't worry - you can adjust this later in cluster settings!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review your settings and click **Create and Deploy**

    Your cluster will now be created automatically!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CloudFormation stack fails">
    **Most common causes:**
    - AWS account doesn't have permissions to create IAM roles
    - AWS region doesn't support EKS

    **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as AWS admin or have IAM permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find the Role ARN">
    1. Go to AWS CloudFormation console
    2. Find your stack (status should be CREATE_COMPLETE)
    3. Click the **Outputs** tab
    4. Copy the value next to "RoleArn"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cluster creation is stuck">
    If your cluster stays in "Creating" status for more than 45 minutes:
    - Check AWS service quotas (especially EC2 instances)
    - Try a different AWS region
    - Contact support through Discord or email
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credentials not working">
    **For STS Assume Role**:
    - Verify CloudFormation stack created successfully
    - Check RoleArn is copied correctly (starts with `arn:aws:iam::`)
    - Ensure AWS account has permissions to create IAM roles

    **For Static Credentials**:
    - Verify IAM user has AdministratorAccess policy
    - Check Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are correct
    - Ensure keys are not disabled or expired
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Your AWS Costs

Your cluster will cost approximately:

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| EKS control plane | $72 |
| 3x t3.large nodes | ~$150 |
| Load balancer | $20 |
| NAT gateway | $30 |
| **Total** | **~$270/month** |

<Tip>
**Save money:**
- Use **spot instances** (60-90% cheaper) for non-production
- Enable **auto-scaling** to use only what you need
- Stop dev/test clusters outside working hours
</Tip>
