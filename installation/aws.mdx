description: "Create your first Kubernetes cluster on AWS in 3 simple steps"
---

Get your first Kubernetes cluster running on AWS in under 30 minutes. This guide walks you through creating credentials and deploying a production-ready cluster.

<Info>
Already have a Kubernetes cluster? See the [BYOK guide](/integrations/kubernetes/byok) instead.
</Info>

## What You'll Get

After following this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ Production-ready EKS cluster
- ✅ Automatic scaling and load balancing
- ✅ SSL certificates and ingress
- ✅ Monitoring and logging
- ✅ Ready to deploy applications

**Time required**: ~30 minutes (mostly automated)

## Prerequisites

<Check>You have a [Qovery account](https://console.qovery.com/signup)</Check>
<Check>You have an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com)</Check>
<Check>You can access the AWS Console</Check>

That's it! No AWS expertise required.

## Step 1: Create AWS Credentials

First, we need to connect your AWS account to Qovery. We'll use **CloudFormation** to create secure credentials automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Cluster Creation">
    1. Log into [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com)
    2. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Clusters**
    3. Click **Create Cluster**
    4. Select **AWS** as cloud provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Add Credentials">
    In the credentials section, click **Add Credentials** or **Create new credentials**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch CloudFormation Stack">
    1. Qovery will show you a **CloudFormation stack link**
    2. Click the link - it opens AWS CloudFormation in a new tab
    3. You'll be automatically logged into AWS (or prompted to log in)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Stack">
    In the AWS CloudFormation page:

    1. Click **Next** (template is pre-filled)
    2. Stack name: keep default or use `qovery-credentials`
    3. Click **Next** twice
    4. ✅ Check **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**
    5. Click **Create stack**

    Wait ~1 minute for **Status: CREATE_COMPLETE**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the Role ARN">
    1. Click the **Outputs** tab
    2. Copy the **RoleArn** value (starts with `arn:aws:iam::`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to Qovery">
    Back in Qovery console:

    1. Paste the **Role ARN**
    2. Give it a name like `AWS Production`
    3. Click **Create**

    Your credentials are now configured! 🎉
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Why CloudFormation?** This creates a secure IAM role that gives Qovery temporary access to your AWS account. It's more secure than using permanent access keys, and you can revoke access anytime by deleting the CloudFormation stack.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Configure Your Cluster

Now let's configure your Kubernetes cluster settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Settings">
    - **Cluster name**: e.g., `production` or `my-first-cluster`
    - **Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1`)
    - **Credentials**: Select the credentials you just created
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instance Type (Optional)">
    Choose the size of your cluster nodes:

    - **t3.medium** (2 vCPU, 4GB) - Good for testing
    - **t3.large** (2 vCPU, 8GB) - Light production ← **Recommended for starters**
    - **t3.xlarge** (4 vCPU, 16GB) - Standard production
    - **Custom** - Choose your own

    Don't worry - you can scale up/down later!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review & Create">
    Review your settings and click **Create and Deploy**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Wait for Cluster Creation

Your cluster is now being created! This takes **20-30 minutes**.

**What's happening:**
1. Creating VPC and networking (3-5 min)
2. Launching EKS control plane (10-15 min)
3. Starting worker nodes (5-10 min)
4. Installing Qovery components (3-5 min)

<Info>
You can close this page and come back later. You'll receive an email when your cluster is ready!
</Info>

**While you wait**, you can:
- ☕ Grab a coffee
- 📖 Read about [deploying your first app](/guides/getting-started/deploy-your-first-application)
- 👥 [Invite team members](/configuration/organization/members-rbac)
- 🔗 [Connect your Git repository](/integrations/git-providers/overview)

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CloudFormation stack fails">
    **Most common causes:**
    - AWS account doesn't have permissions to create IAM roles
    - AWS region doesn't support EKS

    **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as AWS admin or have IAM permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find the Role ARN">
    1. Go to AWS CloudFormation console
    2. Find your stack (status should be CREATE_COMPLETE)
    3. Click the **Outputs** tab
    4. Copy the value next to "RoleArn"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cluster creation is stuck">
    If your cluster stays in "Creating" status for more than 45 minutes:
    - Check AWS service quotas (especially EC2 instances)
    - Try a different AWS region
    - Contact support through Discord or email
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to use Access Keys instead">
    While we recommend CloudFormation for security, you can use static credentials:

    1. Create IAM user in AWS with AdministratorAccess
    2. Generate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
    3. In Qovery, select "Static Credentials" instead
    4. Enter your keys

    ⚠️ Remember to rotate these keys regularly (every 90 days).

## Understanding Your AWS Costs

Your cluster will cost approximately:

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| EKS control plane | $72 |
| 3x t3.large nodes | ~$150 |
| Load balancer | $20 |
| NAT gateway | $30 |
| **Total** | **~$270/month** |

<Tip>
**Save money:**
- Use **spot instances** (60-90% cheaper) for non-production
- Enable **auto-scaling** to use only what you need
- Stop dev/test clusters outside working hours
</Tip>
