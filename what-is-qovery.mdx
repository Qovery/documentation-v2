## Overview

Qovery is an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that empowers developers to deploy and manage their applications on their own cloud infrastructure without requiring deep DevOps expertise. It provides a self-service platform that abstracts away the complexity of Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure management.

## Core Principles
