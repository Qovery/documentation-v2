## Security Layers

### 1. Infrastructure Security

- **Your Cloud Account**: Resources run in your infrastructure
- **Network Isolation**: VPC and subnet isolation
- **Firewall Rules**: Configurable security groups
- **Private Networking**: Databases not exposed to internet

### 2. Application Security

- **Container Scanning**: Automatic vulnerability scanning
- **Image Signing**: Verify container image integrity
- **Runtime Security**: Detect anomalous behavior
- **Secrets Injection**: No secrets in code or logs

### 3. Access Control

- **SSO Integration**: SAML, OAuth 2.0
- **MFA**: Multi-factor authentication
- **API Tokens**: Scoped and time-limited
- **RBAC**: Fine-grained permissions

### 4. Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3
- **Secret Encryption**: AES-256 encryption
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted backups
