## Overview

Qovery works on top of Kubernetes and extends it into a production-ready super orchestrator. By adding powerful automation, management capabilities, and developer-friendly interfaces on top of Kubernetes, Qovery transforms it into a complete DevOps Automation Platform.

## Kubernetes as the Foundation

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, but it was designed for infrastructure operators, not developers. Qovery extends Kubernetes with:

- **Developer Experience** - Self-service [deployment](/configuration/deployment/overview) without Kubernetes expertise
- **Production Readiness** - Built-in [security](/guides/qovery-101/secure), [monitoring](/guides/qovery-101/observe), and compliance
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Deploy to [AWS](/installation/aws), [Google Cloud](/installation/gcp), [Azure](/installation/azure), or [Scaleway](/installation/scaleway)
- **Infrastructure Orchestration** - Manage not just containers, but [databases](/configuration/database), storage, and any cloud resource via [Terraform](/configuration/terraform)

## The Super Orchestrator

Qovery turns Kubernetes into a super orchestrator that manages:

## Your Infrastructure, Your Control

Unlike traditional PaaS solutions, Qovery runs on **your own Kubernetes clusters** in **your cloud accounts**:

- **Full Ownership** - Complete control over your infrastructure
- **No Vendor Lock-in** - Standard Kubernetes underneath
- **Cost Transparency** - Direct cloud provider billing
- **Data Sovereignty** - Your data stays in your infrastructure

## How Qovery Extends Kubernetes

### 1. Developer-Friendly Abstraction

Qovery provides multiple interfaces to work with Kubernetes without requiring deep Kubernetes knowledge:

- **Web Console** - Visual interface for managing applications
- **[CLI](/cli/overview)** - Command-line interface for automation
- **[Terraform Provider](/configuration/terraform)** - Infrastructure as Code
- **[REST API](/api/overview)** - Programmatic access
- **[MCP Server](/copilot/mcp-server)** - AI Copilot integration with agentic capabilities

### 2. Production-Ready Features

Qovery adds enterprise features that Kubernetes doesn't provide out of the box:

- **Automatic HTTPS** - Free SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
- **GitOps Workflow** - [Automatic deployments](/configuration/deployment/auto-deploy) from [Git](/configuration/organization/git-repository-access)
- **[Preview Environments](/guides/advanced/preview-environments)** - Temporary environments for pull requests
- **[Database Management](/configuration/database)** - Provision and manage databases alongside applications
- **[Secrets Management](/configuration/environment-variables)** - Encrypted secret storage with audit logging
- **Cost Tracking** - Real-time visibility into resource costs

### 3. Universal Infrastructure Orchestration

Qovery uses Kubernetes as a universal control plane for managing **any cloud resource**, not just containers:

- **Databases** - AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database
- **Storage** - S3 buckets, Cloud Storage, Azure Blob
- **Networking** - VPCs, load balancers, DNS
- **Serverless** - Lambda functions, Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers
- **Analytics** - BigQuery, Redshift, data pipelines
- **Any Terraform Module** - Deploy any cloud resource via Terraform

This means you can manage your entire cloud infrastructure—from containers to databases to serverless functions—through a single unified platform orchestrated by Kubernetes.

## Simple Workflow

Here's how it works in practice:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Git Repository">
    Link your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to Qovery
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Application">
    Define your application settings, environment variables, and dependencies
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Push your code to Git. Qovery automatically builds, tests, and [deploys to Kubernetes](/configuration/deployment/overview)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor & Scale">
    Track performance, scale resources, and optimize costs—all from the Qovery interface
  </Step>
</Steps>
