## Overview

Qovery works on top of Kubernetes and extends it into a production-ready super orchestrator. By adding powerful automation, management capabilities, and developer-friendly interfaces on top of Kubernetes, Qovery transforms it into a complete DevOps Automation Platform.

## Kubernetes as the Foundation

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, but it was designed for infrastructure operators, not developers. Qovery extends Kubernetes with:

- **Developer Experience** - Self-service deployment without Kubernetes expertise
- **Production Readiness** - Built-in security, monitoring, and compliance
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Deploy to AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or Scaleway
- **Infrastructure Orchestration** - Manage not just containers, but databases, storage, and any cloud resource via Terraform

## The Super Orchestrator

Qovery turns Kubernetes into a super orchestrator that manages:

## Your Infrastructure, Your Control

Unlike traditional PaaS solutions, Qovery runs on **your own Kubernetes clusters** in **your cloud accounts**:

- **Full Ownership** - Complete control over your infrastructure
- **No Vendor Lock-in** - Standard Kubernetes underneath
- **Cost Transparency** - Direct cloud provider billing
- **Data Sovereignty** - Your data stays in your infrastructure

## How Qovery Extends Kubernetes

### 1. Developer-Friendly Abstraction

Qovery provides multiple interfaces to work with Kubernetes without requiring deep Kubernetes knowledge:

- **Web Console** - Visual interface for managing applications
- **CLI** - Command-line interface for automation
- **Terraform Provider** - Infrastructure as Code
- **REST API** - Programmatic access
- **MCP Server** - AI Copilot integration with agentic capabilities

### 2. Production-Ready Features

Qovery adds enterprise features that Kubernetes doesn't provide out of the box:

- **Automatic HTTPS** - Free SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
- **GitOps Workflow** - Automatic deployments from Git
- **Preview Environments** - Temporary environments for pull requests
- **Database Management** - Provision and manage databases alongside applications
- **Secrets Management** - Encrypted secret storage with audit logging
- **Cost Tracking** - Real-time visibility into resource costs

### 3. Universal Infrastructure Orchestration

Qovery uses Kubernetes as a universal control plane for managing **any cloud resource**, not just containers:

- **Databases** - AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database
- **Storage** - S3 buckets, Cloud Storage, Azure Blob
- **Networking** - VPCs, load balancers, DNS
- **Serverless** - Lambda functions, Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers
- **Analytics** - BigQuery, Redshift, data pipelines
- **Any Terraform Module** - Deploy any cloud resource via Terraform

This means you can manage your entire cloud infrastructure—from containers to databases to serverless functions—through a single unified platform orchestrated by Kubernetes.

## Simple Workflow

Here's how it works in practice:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Git Repository">
    Link your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to Qovery
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Application">
    Define your application settings, environment variables, and dependencies
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Push your code to Git. Qovery automatically builds, tests, and deploys to Kubernetes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor & Scale">
    Track performance, scale resources, and optimize costs—all from the Qovery interface
  </Step>
</Steps>
