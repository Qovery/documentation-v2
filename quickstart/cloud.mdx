title: "Create Your Cluster"
description: "Set up a managed Kubernetes cluster as the foundation for your Qovery deployment"
---

<Info>
**This is Step 1**: Creating a cluster is the prerequisite for deploying applications with Qovery. After setting up your cluster, you'll continue with your specific use case guide.
</Info>

**Time:** ~30 minutes

## Why Create a Cluster First?

Your Kubernetes cluster is the foundation where all your applications, databases, and services will run. Qovery provisions and manages this cluster for you, handling:
- Kubernetes installation and configuration
- Networking, load balancing, and SSL/TLS
- Auto-scaling and high availability
- Security and compliance
- Monitoring and logging

**After cluster creation**, you'll return to complete your chosen use case:
- **Production Applications** → [Continue with production guide](/guides/use-cases/production-environment-management)
- **Ephemeral Environments** → [Continue with ephemeral guide](/guides/use-cases/ephemeral-environment)
