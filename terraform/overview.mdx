## Overview

The Qovery Terraform Provider allows you to manage your Qovery infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). With this provider, you can define, provision, and manage your applications, databases, and environments declaratively.

## Installation

Add the Qovery provider to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    qovery = {
      source  = "qovery/qovery"
      version = "~> 0.45.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "qovery" {
  token = var.qovery_api_token
}
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Qovery API, you need an API token. You can generate one from the [Qovery Console](https://console.qovery.com).

Set your token as an environment variable:

```bash
export QOVERY_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

Or pass it directly in your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
provider "qovery" {
  token = "your-api-token"
}
```

<Warning>
Never commit API tokens to version control. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.
</Warning>
