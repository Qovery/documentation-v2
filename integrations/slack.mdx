## Overview

The Slack integration enables automatic team notifications whenever changes occur within your applications. Users can customize which actions trigger Slack workspace messages.

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

Navigate to the [Slack app creation page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and build a new application from scratch. The app should be named "Qovery" and connected to the desired workspace.

<Info>
You can customize your Slack app with an optional logo available from [Qovery's public resources repository](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6046393ad41fc8c21e77d3d7/60c0dc4f7c3f2e3e6e2c3b5f_qovery-logo-square.png).

## Step 2: Configure Incoming Webhooks

Activate the Incoming Webhooks feature within your app, then add a new webhook to your workspace. Select the target notification channel and copy the generated webhook URL.

<Note>
Multiple webhooks can target different channels. Specific events can be filtered (e.g., `"events": ["DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE"]`). Webhooks are manageable and deletable anytime.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure Qovery Webhook

Reference the [webhook documentation](/integrations/webhooks) to establish the connection within Qovery, using the copied Slack webhook URL as the endpoint.

## Step 4: Test the Integration

Launch a deployment to verify notifications appear in your designated Slack channel.
