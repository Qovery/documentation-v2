Doppler is a universal secrets manager that integrates with Qovery. Doppler allows you to store and manage your application secrets in a single place and access them from anywhere.

Check out [this Doppler documentation](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/qovery) to integrate Qovery with your Doppler account.

## Prerequisites

You will need:
- An active Qovery account with at least one project
- An application, container, or job in your Qovery project
- A Doppler account

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Generate a Qovery API Token

From your Qovery dashboard, navigate to your organization settings and generate a new API token.

Learn more about [generating API tokens](/configuration/organization/api-token).

### Step 2: Select Qovery Integration in Doppler

In Doppler, navigate to the Integrations section and select **Qovery** from the list of available integrations.

### Step 3: Connect Doppler to Qovery

Name your integration and paste the API token you generated in Step 1.

### Step 4: Configure the Sync

Select your Qovery scope, project, environment, and target resource (application, container, or job). Choose which Doppler config to sync and configure the import behavior for any pre-existing variables.

## How It Works

Once configured, Doppler provides immediate and continuous syncing of secrets from your Doppler config to your Qovery applications, containers, or jobs. Your deployed applications will automatically fetch secrets from Doppler.
