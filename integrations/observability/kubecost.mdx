## What is Kubecost?

Kubecost helps you:

- **Monitor costs**: Track spending by namespace, service, label, and more
- **Identify waste**: Find over-provisioned resources and idle workloads
- **Optimize resources**: Get recommendations to reduce costs
- **Set budgets**: Create alerts and budgets for cost control

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Helm Repository">
    In Qovery Console, add the Kubecost Helm repository:

    1. Go to your **Organization** settings
    2. Navigate to **Helm Repositories**
    3. Click **Add Repository**
    4. Configure the repository:
       - **Name**: Kubecost
       - **Repository URL**: `https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/`
    5. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Kubecost Helm Chart">
    Deploy the Kubecost cost-analyzer chart:

    1. Go to your **Environment**
    2. Click **Add Service** → **Helm**
    3. Configure the Helm service:
       - **Name**: kubecost
       - **Source**: Select the Kubecost repository
       - **Chart Name**: `cost-analyzer`
       - **Chart Version**: `1.108.0` (or latest)

    4. **Optional**: Add Kubecost Token for additional features
       - Create an environment variable: `KUBECOST_TOKEN`
       - Mark it as **Secret**
       - Set the value to your Kubecost token

    5. Add values override (if using token):
       ```yaml
       kubecostToken: qovery.env.KUBECOST_TOKEN
       ```

    6. Click **Create** and deploy
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expose Kubecost Dashboard">
    Make Kubecost accessible via a public URL:

    1. Wait for deployment to complete
    2. View deployment logs to find the service name

    <img src="/images/kubecost/service-name.png" alt="Find Kubecost service name in logs" />

    The service name will look like: `helm-z325f0565-kubecost-cost-analyzer`

    3. Go to your Helm service → **Settings** → **Networking**
    4. Click **Add Port**

    <img src="/images/kubecost/add-port.png" alt="Add port configuration" />

    5. Configure the port:
       - **Service Name**: `helm-YOUR_ID-kubecost-cost-analyzer` (from logs)
       - **Service Port**: `9090`
       - **Protocol**: HTTP
       - **Public**: Enable

    6. Click **Save** and redeploy

    7. Once deployed, you'll see a public URL to access Kubecost

    <img src="/images/kubecost/link.png" alt="Kubecost public URL" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing Kubecost

Once deployed, click the public URL to access the Kubecost dashboard. You'll see:

- **Cost allocation**: Breakdown by namespace, deployment, service, and label
- **Savings insights**: Recommendations to reduce costs
- **Cluster health**: Resource utilization and efficiency metrics
- **Reports**: Custom cost reports and alerts

## Using Kubecost

### Monitor Costs by Namespace

View spending breakdown by namespace to identify which environments or teams are consuming the most resources.

### Identify Waste

Kubecost highlights:
- **Abandoned resources**: Workloads no longer in use
- **Over-provisioned pods**: Resources allocated but not used
- **Idle resources**: Low utilization workloads

### Get Optimization Recommendations

Kubecost provides actionable recommendations:
- Right-size pod requests and limits
- Reduce replica counts for low-traffic services
- Switch to spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Consolidate underutilized nodes

### Set Budgets and Alerts

Create budgets and get alerts when spending exceeds thresholds:
- Monthly budget by namespace
- Cost anomaly detection
- Slack/email notifications
