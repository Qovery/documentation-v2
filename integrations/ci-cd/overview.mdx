## Common Use Cases

### Build and Deploy

1. **CI/CD builds** container image
2. **Push to registry** (ECR, Docker Hub, etc.)
3. **Trigger Qovery deployment** via CLI/API
4. **Monitor deployment** status

### Preview Environments

- Create temporary environment for each pull request
- Automatically deploy and test changes
- Clean up after merge
- Comment PR with environment URL

### Environment Cloning

- Clone production to staging
- Run tests against clone
- Update configurations
- Deploy changes

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    In Qovery Console: Settings → API Tokens → Generate Token
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to CI/CD Secrets">
    Store as `QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your CI/CD platform secrets
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Qovery CLI">
    Add CLI installation step to your pipeline
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Use Qovery CLI commands to deploy applications
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Qovery CLI in CI/CD

### Authentication

```bash
# Set token in environment
export QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN=${{ secrets.QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

# CLI will auto-authenticate
qovery application deploy
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Deploy application
qovery application deploy --application-name my-app --commit-id $COMMIT_SHA

# Create preview environment
qovery environment create --name pr-$PR_NUMBER --clone-from staging

# Delete environment
qovery environment delete --name pr-$PR_NUMBER

# Check deployment status
qovery application status --application-name my-app
```
